        Causal tracing shows which drivers are responsible for a particular change 
        in indicators or land use. Causal tracing in Eururalis 2.0 is divided 
        into two sections. The section of the core model chain and the section 
        that relates to the indicators. Causal tracing within the model chain 
        is dealt with in result description of land use (link). Causal tracing 
        within the part of the indicators is described by the indicator specialists 
        in the result section (link) and in the factsheets (link). Another way 
        to find out relationship between cause and consequences is the use of 
        policy options. By manipulating the different options, within the different 
        scenarios and over different time periods will give a direct notion of 
        the possible effects. The manipulation fo contrasting options within both 
        different scenarios and time periods, can lead to the understanding of 
        possible effects. </p></td>
