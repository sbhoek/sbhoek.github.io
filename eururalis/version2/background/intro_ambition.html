  The ambition of the Eururalis project is to support policy makers in strategic 
  discussions and decision making. The outputs of Eururalis outline what could 
  happen in rural Europe towards 2030, based on conditions that differ in nature, 
  course, duration or place.</b></p> 
<p>Eururalis 2.0 is the follow-up of Eururalis 1.0 (2004). The main concept and 
  architecture of Eururalis 1.0 is preserved. This means continuation of the same 
  four contrasting scenarios. Also the model framework is maintained by using 
  the same major driving forces that are considered crucial for future developments. 
  The inclusion of global processes (for example the expected growth of food consumption 
  in Asia) and relevant data is preserved. Eururalis 2.0 differs from version 
  1.0 in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Adding policy relevance. By giving policy makers the option to take or 
    undo measures they can explore the impacts of altered policies on for example 
    CAP or biofuels.</li>
  <li>Downscaling information from the country level to the level of European 
    regions. This gives policy makers a better understanding of the relevance 
    of future policy and driving forces for their region.</li>
  <li> Better causal tracing:what causes certain indicators to change?</li>
  <li> More interactivity. Users can themselves browse the outcomes for different 
    indicators and different scenarios. The results are presented in maps and 
    graphs and with explanatory text.</li>
  <li> Broadening of the basis. More international partners have joined.</li>
  <li> Extension from EU25 to EU27.</li>
  <li> A better and more transparent presentation of the assumptions and the results.<br>
  </li>
