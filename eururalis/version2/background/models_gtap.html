        The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model was adapted for Eururalis.

      <p>In order to analyze the economic and environmental consequences of economic, 
        policy and demographic changes as well as changes in policies that influence 
        European and global agriculture and land use a framework was developed

<p>The global economy is modelled with an extended version of the Computable General 
  Equilibrium (CGlobal Economy) model GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project), which combines 
  the advantages of the global CGlobal Economy approach, taking into consideration the impact 
  of non-agricultural sectors on agriculture and a full treatment of factor markets, 
  with the specific features of partial equilibrium models concerning land modeling. 
  The standard GTAP model is characterized by an input-output structure based 
  on regional and national input-output tables. It explicitly links industries 
  in a value added chain from primary goods, over continuously higher stages of 
  intermediate processing, to the final assembling of goods and services for consumption. 
  For this analysis an extended version of the standard GTAP model was developed 
  that improved the treatment of agricultural production and land use. Since it 
  was assumed that the various types of land use are imperfectly substitutable, 
  the land use allocation structure was extended by taking into account different 
  degrees of substitutability between land use types. Therefore, OECD&#8217;s 
  more detailed Policy Evaluation Model structure was used. It is essential that 
  land supply, which is normally exogenous in CGlobal Economy models, is made endogenous by 
  including a land supply curve since land can move into or out of agricultural 
  production due to several reasons, leading to exceeding or undershooting the 
  total available agricultural area. For example, land supply to agriculture can 
  be adjusted as a result of idling of agricultural land, conversion of non-agricultural 
  land to agriculture, conversion of agricultural land to urban use and agricultural 
  land abandonment. For each country in Europe and world region outside Europe 
  a land supply curve was estimated which specifies the relation between land 
  supply and a rental rate. This land supply curve specifies that increase in 
  demand for agricultural purposes will lead to land conversion when land resources 
  are abundant, whilst increases in demand will result in strong increases in 
  rental rate when there are shortages of land.</p>
<p>The most important inputs of the GTAP model are the demographic, macro-economic 
  and technological developments and policy assumptions. Demographic and macro-economic 
  assumptions are expressed by population numbers and GDP, employment and capital 
  growth. Technological growth is partly determined endogenously with relative 
  factor prices and a yield component that is exogenously based on the scenario 
  conditions. For the different scenarios relevant policy assumptions are implemented, 
  including quota, changes of import tariffs and export subsidies and land subsidies 
  for specific crops. </p>
<p>An important factor in the calculation of demand for agricultural land is yield. 
  In the extended GTAP model yield depends on a trend factor and on relative factor 
  prices. The production structure used implies that substitution among production 
  factors is possible, i.e., if the land rent increases the producer may increase 
  the use of other production factors, such as capital and labour, which leads 
  to improved yields. <br>
  The GTAP model calculates changes in land demand by maximizing a profit function 
  for a representative producer for each sector of a country or region. Therefore, 
  the model assumes homogeneity of all conditions within the country and cannot 
  account for impacts of land use change on land productivity as result of expansion 
  on or abandonment of marginal land. Furthermore, the economic analysis is not 
  able to deal with region-specific effects of climate change on yield.</p>
