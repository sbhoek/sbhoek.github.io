        The Eururalis project is very challenging from the scientific point of 
        view. It integrates methodological concepts from different domains such 
        as economy, demography, land-use and biofysical factors. The links between 
        the various models and the different temporal and spatial scales has not 
        only lead to model connections but also it has build connection between 
        groups of experts that previous did not interact. In future the Eururalis 
        conceptual framework will be futher developed. In this section the main 
        improvements for the follow up versions of Eururalis 2.0 are described.</b></p>

<p>Land supply curves are new in Eururalis 2.0. In GTAP the total agricultural 
              land supply was modeled using a land supply curve which specifies 
              the relationship between land supply and a land rental rate in each 
              region.<b> </b></p>
            <p>The concept underlying the land supply curve specification is that 
              the most productive land is first to be taken into production. However, 
              the potential for bringing additional land into agriculture is limited. 
              If the gap between potentially available agricultural land and land 
              used in the agricultural sector is large, then the increase in demand 
              for agricultural land will lead to land conversion to agricultural 
              land and a modest increase in rental rates to compensate for the 
              cost to take this land into production.</p>

      The problem in Eururalis 1.0 was that GTAP seems to use available land too 
      fast. This results in land conversion to agricultural land-use where it 
      is not realistic. Although improvements have been made further study on 
      this issue is needed. <br>

      <b>Regionalization of models</b><br>
      In order to provide socio-economic indicators at a regional level use of 
      a regional economic approach, that addresses the full (rural) economy and 
      not only agriculture, is needed. In many rural regions agriculture only 
      contributes a low amount to the regional economy. Basically a regional economic 
      approach requires a nesting of regional modeling within the macro-level 
      modeling leading to feedbacks between farm/region level conditions/constraints/ 
      opportunities and macro-economic trends at national to global levels. An 
      innovative approach of dealing with the land resource base is essential 
      here.. 
      <p>Regionalization is also essential in order to better implement a policy 
        option dealing with second pillar rural development policies and assess 
        the consequences of structural change in agriculture for rural livelihoods.

        is not as detailed as the representation of the agricultural sector. This 
        leads to some unbalance in the modeling system and the representation

        Currently these issues are hardly addressed by Eururalis. To address these 
        issues in a proper manner a better representation of the regional economy 
        is needed, as well as an improved representation of farming systems and 
        an identification of landscape functionality.<br>
        Potential for green services (non-commodity outputs) and eligibility for

        One important missing &#8216;planet&#8217; indicator is the emission of 
        greenhouse gasses. There are several gasses contributing to greenhouse 
        emissions. Existing models and methodologies should be implemented into 
        the Eururalis framework to fill this gap. This should include N-emissions 
        and CO<font size="-2">2</font> emissions from agriculture source. The 
        first stage should focus on emissions linked to land-use and agriculture. 
        In a later phase emissions from other sources (transport, industry) could
