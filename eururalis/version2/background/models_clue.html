        The CLUE model (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects; CLUE-s version 
        2.3) is used to allocate the predicted changes in land use generated by 
        IMAGE at a 1 km<sup>2</sup>  resolution.A spatially explicit land use change</b></p>
      <p>model is used to translate the aggregate land use change at the national 
        level to high-resolution patterns (1x1 km) of land use change for the 
        25 countries of the European Union. In this study the Conversion of Land 
        Use and its Effects model (CLUE-s version 2.4) is used. The CLUE-s model 
        is based on the dynamic simulation of competition between land uses while 
        the spatial allocation rules can be specified based on either an empirical 
        analysis, user-specified decision rules, neighborhood characteristics 
        (similar to cellular automata models) or a combination of these methods.

<p>The actual allocation is based on a set of constraints and preferences that 
  reflect the characteristics of the land use type, location and the assumed processes 
  and constraints relevant to the scenario. Differences between scenarios are 
  obtained by differences in data inputs and parameter settings that affect the 
  behaviour of the model. The approach considers eight different land use types: 
  dry land arable agriculture, irrigated agriculture, grassland, abandoned agricultural 
  land, built-up area, natural vegetation types including production forest (also 
  coniferous plantations), inland wetlands and a class of miscellaneous land use 
  types which are assumed to show little dynamics in time (including beaches, 
  glaciers and bare rock).</p>
<p>The land requirements for the different land use types determine the actual 
  area that is allocated by the model (Figure 2). These demands are specified 
  for each country separately. Changes in agricultural land areas are based on 
  the results of the combined simulations with the global economic (GTAP) and 
  integrated assessment model (IMAGE) as described above. Growth in built-up area 
  is calculated proportional to changes in population, GDP (as a proxy for changes 
  in household structure and space requirements for residential and recreational 
  purposes) and the growth in the industrial/services sectors calculated by the 
  GTAP model. Changes in natural area are restricted by the scenario specific 
  protection of nature reserves and, otherwise, follow land availability after 
  accounting for changes in agricultural and built-up area. If land is available, 
  nature development can occur spontaneous as result of re-growth of natural vegetation 
  on abandoned lands or more directly through active management of former agricultural 
  areas to develop natural vegetation.</p>
<p>Whereas the demand for land by the different land use types determines the 
  overall competitive capacity of the different land use types, the location suitability 
  is a major determinant of the competitive capacity of the different land use 
  types at a specific location. A wide range of local and regional factors can 
  influence the suitability of a location for a land use type. Besides the commonly 
  considered biophysical suitability in terms of crop growth potential, other 
  factors, such as accessibility or neighborhood characteristics, should be considered 
  as factors influencing the location suitability as perceived by the decision 
  maker. The location suitability is a weighted average of the suitability based 
  on empirical analysis capturing the historic and current location preferences 
  in response to location characteristics, the influence of neighboring land uses 
  on location suitability (e.g., in case of agglomeration effects) and suitabilities 
  based on scenario specific decision rules. It is assumed that in the different 
  scenarios the decision makers may have a different perception of location suitability 
  as result of changes in worldview, policy incentives and extension. As an example, 
  in the<em> Global Economy (A1)</em> scenario it is assumed that potential crop 
  productivity may be a more important factor determining location suitability 
  than in other scenarios. Empirical analysis is used to capture the current and 
  historic preferences for locations based on a logistic regression relating land 
  use patterns to a wide range of potential factors that are expected to determine 
  the location suitability. The location characteristics included in this analysis 
  include, among others, accessibility, soil and geomorphology, climate, population 
  density and altitude. For each country the analysis was conducted separately 
  to allow region dependent factors to be included. The empirical relations capture 
  the current structure of land use and the response to changes in dynamic location 
  factors (such as population), but do not allow for changes in spatial behavior 
  as assumed in the different scenarios or the impacts of region specific policies. 
  The latter is accounted for by the specification of area-specific conditions 
  while changes in behavior are dealt with by adapting the calculated suitability 
  with decision rules that reflect the assumed changes in location preferences. 
  These include the different preferences for new built-up land and urbanization 
  policies. <br>
  In addition to the land requirements and location suitabilities the model accounts 
  for land use type specific characteristics that influence the conversion and 
  cause differences in spatio-temporal behavior. Whilst urban growth in almost 
  all cases results in a one-way conversion of other land uses into built-up land, 
  arable land can still increase in a region while the region overall faces a 
  decrease of agricultural land. Therefore each land use type is characterized 
  in the model by a conversion elasticity and a specification of all plausible 
  conversions. </p>
<p>Finally, for each of the scenarios, several region specific spatial policies 
  were defined and implemented in the model. Some of these policies are implemented 
  as a restriction on all conversions in the specified area (e.g., nature reserves) 
  or as a restriction on specific conversions. Other spatial policies are implemented 
  as an increase in the location suitability for one or more of the land use types 
  in the specific area; e.g., support for farmers in less favoured areas (LFA's) 
  is implemented as an increase in location suitability relative to similar locations 
  outside the LFA's.</p>
