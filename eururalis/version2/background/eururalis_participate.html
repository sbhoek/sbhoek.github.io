  Eururalis is all about looking ahead. There are still many scientific challenges 
  and policy questions left which in the third version of Eururalis will be adressed. 
  The aim of Eururalis 3.0 will be to work in international consortia on scientific 
  methods for the Eururalis framework. Therefore, if you are intersted in participating 
  anad have a scientific module to contribute please contact the project leader. 
  This will take place in close cooperation with EU and national policy makers 
  in order to make the results relevant to issues which are most important to 
  them. </p> 
<p>In Eururalis 3.0 some new policy topics will be addressed. Meetings with the 
  policy makers have showed that the implementation of the Water Framework Directive 
  and policies on Nature and Green services are a priority. Also the further elaboration 
  fo the bio-energy modules in Eururalis, especially the implementation of second 
  generation bio-energy and the use of waste material is planned in Eururalis 
  3.0.</p>
<p>In addition to new policy options an indicator on greenhouse gasses is needed. 
  Furthermore the regionalization of the economic models will bring further improvement 
  to the overall model.</p>
