      <p>In order to simultaneaously estimate the effects of land use change and

        indicators, use is made of the integrated assessment model IMAGE (Integrated 
        Model to Assess the Global Environment.The calculations of IMAGE start 
        with the exogenous driving forces of population and economic growth and 
        with the results of the global economic model, including sectoral production 
        growth rates and changes in yield, partly on basis of endogenously determined 
        intensification/extensification processes.</p></td>

<p> The IMAGE model allocates the agricultural production on a global grid with 
  a 0.5 by 0.5 degrees resolution to account for heterogeneity of land resources 
  based on a simple allocation mechanism that basically allocates land expansion 
  to areas with the highest potential yield and close to existing agricultural 
  land and land abandonment on the least productive areas. The allocation mechanism 
  of agricultural land also accounts for the distribution of population, the vicinity 
  to water and a random factor. To account for climate change, the emissions of 
  the energy sector need to be considered. Emissions from the energy sector are 
  taken from Bollen et al. (2004), in which the same driving forces and scenario 
  assumptions are used for future projections of the energy sector. The atmospheric 
  and ocean models connected to IMAGE calculate changes in atmospheric composition 
  by employing the emissions and by taking oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and atmospheric 
  chemistry into consideration. Subsequently, changes in climatic properties are 
  computed by resolving oceanic heat transport and the changes in radiation forcing 
  by greenhouse gases and aerosols. The impact models involve specific models 
  for sea-level rise and land degradation risk and make use of specific features 
  of the ecosystem and crop models to depict impacts on vegetation and crop growth. 
  The climate and CO<sub>2</sub> feedbacks are simulated dynamically, and together with the 
  impact on yields due to land use change, they provide a modified crop yield 
  for each country or world region considered in the GTAP model. A similar procedure 
  is followed for feed conversion factors for the livestock sector. Table 2 provides 
  an example of the changes in yield resulting from climate change and changes 
  in land allocation. These changes are small when compared to the calculated 
  yield increase by technology. However, a 2% difference may directly translate 
  in land abandonment on 2% of the agricultural area, which is a considerable 
  area at the scale of Europe. Expansion of agriculture has a negative impact 
  on average yield levels in most developing countries due to expansion of cropland 
  in marginal areas while land abandonment on marginal areas in Europe leads to 
  increases in average yield levels.</p>
<p>These modifications to the yield will affect production levels. Therefore, 
  they are fed back to the GTAP model, which simulates new production results 
  based on the adapted yields. The simulations of both models are continued iteratively 
  until the output of the global economy and integrated assessment model with 
  respect to agricultural land area change are consistent (Figure 2). This way 
  the economical and environmental processes leading to changes in agricultural 
  area are modeled consistently and, at the same time, some global level environmental 
  indicators can be calculated.</p>
