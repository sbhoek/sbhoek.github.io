      Eururalis 2.0 has two main objectives. The first objective is to provide 
      a tool for a structured strategic discussion at a European scale. This enables 
      discussions between policy makers, stakeholders and scientists from different 
      domains and/or countries. <br>
      The second objective is to develop and improve Eururalis in order to produce 
      a scientifically sound framework for integrated assessment at the European 
      level. Within this framework developments on different scales (from global 
      to local) and contrasting issues are connected. Given the complexity and 
      broad perspective the development of the Eururalis tool is carried out in 
      a number of steps: This is version 2.0.</td>
