        <b>The methodology is designed to quantify a set of scenarios based on 
        models at different scales. Figure 1 provides an overview of the procedure. 
        The first step is the elaboration of the general storylines by specifying 
        the conditions that are needed to make an assessment of land use dynamics. 
        </b></p>
      <p><b>This process includes the specification of demographic and economic 
        trends, world trade regulations, consumer preferences and policies that 
        directly or indirectly influence land use. Many of these variables, such 
        as the expected economic and demographic developments need to be quantified 
        since these are critical input to the models. </b></p>
      <p>No single model is able to capture all key processes necessary to explore 
        land use change in Europe at the different scales relevant to make a full 
        assessment of driving factors and impacts. Therefore, a series of different 
        models is used to account for the structure of land use change processes. 
        The demand for agricultural land in Europe is mainly dependent on global 
        developments in agricultural production, world trade agreements and changes 
        in the economy of sectors outside agriculture. </p></td>

<p>Global models are used to account for the effect of changes at the global level 
  on European land use. At the same time, the global-level assessment also allows 
  an evaluation of the effects of changes in Europe on other parts of the world, 
  including an assessment of the trade offs of European land use change for developing 
  countries.</p>
<p> In this study a combination of a global economy model and a global integrated 
  assessment model is used to capture the interaction between economy and natural 
  resources. The world economy model calculates the economic consequences for 
  the agricultural sector by describing features of the global food market and 
  the dynamics that arise from the exogenous scenario assumptions. Regional food 
  production and impacts on productivity (through intensification or extensification) 
  as calculated by the global economy model are used as input of the integrated 
  assessment model. This model is used to calculate the effects of land use change 
  and climate change on yield level and simulates feed efficiency rates and a 
  number of environmental indicators. Together, these global models result in 
  an assessment of the agricultural land use changes at the level of individual 
  countries inside Europe and for larger regions outside Europe (Eickhout et al., 
  2006; Meijl et al., 2006). At the same time these models also calculate changes 
  in other sectors of the economy which are indirectly related to land use. This 
  information is used in a series of simple models (Figure 1). For the industry 
  and services sectors the changes in sector size are translated into land requirements 
  for these sectors (Figure 2). For the natural and residential land use types 
  the claims for land area are based on the demographic and policy assumptions 
  as described in the storylines (Figure 2).</p>
<p>It is obvious that the global models are not able to make an assessment beyond 
  the resolution of individual countries. Land use within a country is variable 
  as result of local variations in social and biophysical conditions. Furthermore, 
  the driving factors of landscape pattern are often region-specific as a consequence 
  of different contextual conditions, specific variation in the socio-economic 
  and biophysical conditions, and the influence of land use history and culture 
  (Nassauer, 1995; Naveh, 2001). The actual downscaling of the national level 
  changes to the landscape level was done by a spatially explicit land use change 
  model at a spatial resolution of 1 km<sup>2</sup>  (Verburg et al., 2006).</p>
<p>Finally, based on the simulated land use changes a number of indicators were 
  calculated to summarize the results and assess the likely impacts. Some indicators 
  are based on the simulated land use changes itself, e.g., the &#8216;hot-spots&#8217; 
  of land use change, while others reflect the economic or environmental changes 
  resulting from the changes in land use. <br>
