  Self-sufficiency of some protected commodities (sugar and cattle) in the EU 
  15 countries declines especially in the global scenarios (Global Economy, Global Cooperation). Self-sufficiency 
  of protected commodities in the EU12 countries increases especially in regional 
  (Continental Markets, Regional Communities) scenarios due to the accession to the EU15 market and the remaining 
  protection of the EU27 market.</b></p>
<p><b>The self-sufficiency of biofuel products (sugar, grains and oilseeds)

  <br>
  Self-sufficiency of some protected commodities (sugar and cattle) in the EU 
  15 countries declines especially in the global scenarios (Global Economy (A1), Global Cooperation(B1)).<br>
  <br>
  <b>Future developments</b><br>
  The general tendency is that the self sufficiency of some protected commodities 
  (sugar, beef and to a lesser extent dairy) declines for the EU15 and the self-sufficiency 
  of non protected products (horticulture, pork and poultry) increases (see, Figure 
  S1). This is most profound in the liberalisation scenarios.<br>
  The self-sufficiency of biofuel products (sugar, grains and oilseeds) declines 
  in the scenario's where the biofuel directive is implemented.<br>

  <br>
  Self-sufficiency of protected commodities in the EU12 countries increases especially 
  in regional (Continental Markets, Regional Communities) scenarios due to the accession to the EU15 market and the 
  remaining protection of the EU27 market.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Explanation</b><br>
  Self sufficiency of protected commodities increases especially in non-liberalisation 
  scenarios. Accession to the larger market of the European Union (trade creation) 
  and the existing CAP facilities increases production and self-sufficiency in 
  the EU12. This is most pronounced in the Regional communities (B2 )scenario 
  where the EU25 market does not integrate further with the rest of the world. 
  In the Continental market (A2) the impact of the preferential access of the 
  EU12 to the EU15 declines because the US get the same preferential access. Another 
  aspect is the lower economic growth in the EU12 in this scenario that implies 
  also a smaller increase in demand.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Policy effects</b><br>
  CAP policies<br>
  Reduction of market and domestic support in the EU15 decrease the self-sufficiency 
  of protected commodities and increase the self-sufficiency of unprotected commodities. 
  Introduction of the CAP policies after enlargement increase the self-sufficiency 
  of protected commodities in the EU12.<br>
  <br>
  Biofuel policies:<br>
  The self-sufficiency of biofuel products (sugar, grains and oilseeds) declines 
  in the scenario's where the biofuel directive is implemented.<br>
