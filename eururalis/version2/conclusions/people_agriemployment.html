  <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
  Negative employment growth in agricultural sectors in EU25 (see also, figures 
  in the Employment indicator part). The decline in agricultural labour is higher 
  in EU12 than in EU15 (compare E1 with E2), although the share of agricultural 
  labour declines faster in the EU15 than in the EU12 (compare E3 and E4). </b></p>
<p><b>The decline in employment and especially the decline in the share of 
  agricultural employment is highest in the scenarios with a high economic growth 
  (Global Economy and Continental Markets). </b></p>
<p><b>The share stays highest in the regional communities scenario. In the 
  B scenarios (Global Cooperation and Regional Communities) in the EU15 the drop in
  labour in the livestock sectors is striking and it is driven by the decline in 
  preference for meat products in these scenarios. </b> </p>

  <br>
  <b>Past developments</b><br>
  The decline of employment in the agricultural sector is a long term trend.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Future developments</b><br>
  The share of agricultural employment declines in all scenarios due to lower 
  production growth in these sectors and a higher labour productivity growth. 
  The decline is highest in the A1 scenario because labour productivity growth 
  is relatively high. High demand growth in the services sectors induces pressure 
  in the labour market and opportunities for people in other sectors. In the low 
  income growth Regional Communities (B2) scenario opportunities for agricultural employees outside 
  agriculture are limited and people stay within the agri-sectors.<br>

  <b>Policy effects</b><br>
  Reducing the CAP policies leads to an increase of labour released from the agricultural 
  sector. The biofuel directive keeps more labour in the agricultural sector.<br>

  <b>Most important drivers</b><br>
  Macro economic growth.<br>
