<b>With help of the spider diagram several indicators can be looked at the 
same time. Doing this the advantages and negative sides of each of the scenarios 
can easily be found. In figure 1 a spider diagram is presented for the four baseline 
scenarios for the year 2030.</b>

<p>From this spider diagram can be derived that there are considerable differences 
  between the scenarios. </p>
<p>The Global Economy scenario combines a high general employment with high GDP, 
  but also high carbons sequestration and high level of biodiversity. Agriculture 
  in this scenario is a sector with a small area and smallest employment only 
  contributing to a small extent to the GDP. Area for nature and urbanization 
  are highest. </p>
<p>The Continental Market scenario combines more modest employment with second 
  highest GDP. Of all scenarios Continental Market uses most land for agriculture 
  and least land for nature. Biodiversity and Carbon sequestration are lowest 
  in this scenario. Just like in the Global Economy scenario only a limited amount 
  of land is used for biofuel production. </p>
<p>The Global Cooperation scenario has also a relative high employment but relative 
  lower GDP. This scenario scores well on biodiversity, carbon sequestration and 
  the area used for natural land. This scenario has an intermediate position for 
  the amount of agricultural land and share of agriculture in GDP. Biofuels are 
  stimulated in this scenario resulting in a high amount of biofuels crops. </p>
<p>The Regional Communities scenario is for many indicators the opposite of the 
  Global Economy scenario. This scenario has highest agro employment, high agro 
  share in GDP combined with low overall employment and GDP. On planet indicators 
  this scenario takes an intermediate position. </p>
<p><b>Differences between EU10 and EU15<br>
  </b>In figure 2 two spider diagrams are presented of the EU10 and the EU15. 
  The shapes of the spider diagrams differ. This shows that future developments 
  in the EU10 will not necessarily show the same trends as in the EU15. This especially 
  seems the case for the Continental Market and the Global Cooperation scenarios. 
  For instance in the Continental Market the highest amount of agricultural land 
  for the EU15 and the lowest in the EU10. </p>
