  <b>Highlight<br>
  Real farm income growth per employee is low for primary agricultural products 
  in relation to the income growth in the rest of the economy. For protected commodities 
  (sugar, cattle, milk) the growth is highly negative in the liberalization scenarios 
  (Global Economy, Global Cooperation or A1 en B1). In the regionalization scenarios the difference between 
  protected and unprotected commodities is limited. </b></p>

  <br>
  <b>Explanation</b><br>
  Overall economic growth has an important impact on real farm income: consumers 
  have higher incomes and consumption patterns. Reduction of border support and 
  domestic support have a significant negative impact on real agricultural income 
  for protected commodities in the global scenarios (Global Economy and Global Cooperation). </p>

  <br>
  Real farm income growth for protected commodities is higher than for non protected 
  products. Changes in border support and domestic support due to accession to 
  EU have a positive impact on real farm income. The impact of the biofuel directive 
  on farm income is also positive.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Explanation</b><br>
  Overall economic growth has an important impact on real farm income: consumers 
  have higher incomes and consumption patterns. Accession to the common EU market 
  (reduction of border support) and domestic support have a positive impact on 
  real agricultural income for protected commodities. The contribution is highest 
  in the regionalisation scenarios (Continental Markets (A2) and Regional Communities (B2)) where domestic support 
  is sustained and not all countries get equal access to the EU15 market (preferential 
  access sustained).<br>
  <br>
  In comparison with the EU15 real farm income growth is higher, especially for 
  protected commodities. Furthermore, the contribution of domestic support and 
  border support is positive in stead of negative.<br>
  <br>
  Implementation of the biofuel directive has a positive impact on farm income 
  for the biofuel products (Oilseeds, grains and to a lesser extend sugar).</p>
