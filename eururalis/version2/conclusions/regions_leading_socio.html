<p><b>Many regions will need extra policy attention regarding future socio-economic 
        developments. Especially regions with a high current share of agricultural 
        employment might face problems finding alternative employment for the 
        labour surplus that arises from the restructuring process. Especially 
        in the eastern and southern parts of Europe socio economic problems may 
        arise. </b></p>
      <p><b>To illustrate which regions are potentially affected a combination 
        of maps with overall economic development and potential labour surplus 
        was made. A combination of these maps results in a regional overview of 
        regions facing problems absorbing this extra labour. Contributions from 
        axis one (competitiveness) and especially axis three (diversification) 
        of the Second Pillar of the Common Agriculture measures will contribute 
        to the needs of the socio-economic lagging regions.</b></p>
      <p><b> In general the importance of the agricultural sector declines 
        in terms of contribution to GDP, employment and income. Whether this might 
        lead to unemployment, lower wages or depopulation in some regions is dependent 
        on the opportunities outside the agricultural sector. In this section 
        we identify a regional typology that identifies regions that might become 
        in trouble in the future. We focus on two effects:</b></p></td>

  <li><b> Redundant agricultural labour effect: The amount of labour disposed 
    from agriculture</b></li>
  <li><b>Absorption effect. Is the rest of the economy able to absorb labor 
    released from agriculture?</b></li>
</ol>
<p>In this study we use the following proxies for these effects:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Redundant agricultural labour effect: Absolute change\reduction in agricultural 
    share in economy. The initial share indicates the importance of agriculture 
    in a region. The absolute change in the share indicates the decline in the 
    importance of agriculture.</li>
  <li>Absorption effect. We use total employment growth in a region as proxy. 
    If regions performed above\below average in the past (leading\lagging) we 
    assume that it can more\less easily absorb the agri-labour. Leading and lagging 
    will be determined from a national perspective: </li>
</ol>
<p><em>These two criteria lead to the following regional typologies</em><br>
  <img src="images/regions_leading1.gif" width="433" height="238"> </p>
The green colors indicate that regions can more easily absorb the released agricultural 
labor. The purple red colors indicate regions where the released labor might cause 
regional problems.<br>
The regional typologies will be constructed for the Global Economy (A1) and Regional 
Communities (B2) scenarios. Before we construct the regional typologies we will 
describe the absorption and decline in agricultural labour effects.

  <br>
  Leading and lagging regions are defined according to their historical performance 
  since 1990. The criteria &#8216;leading&#8217; or &#8216;lagging&#8217; are 
  calculated relative to the national average employment growth rate since 1990. 
  The absorption capacity is the same for the different scenarios.</p>

  Figure 2 - Importance of Agriculture in 2001</p>
<p>Agriculture contributes significantly to regional GDP in southern Spain and 
  Portugal, in many regions in South-Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Romania and Greece) 
  as well as in most Baltic countries. In Central Europe agriculture plays only 
  a minor role.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="images/regions_leading4.jpg" width="437" height="400"><br>
  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 3 - Change in Agricultural Share of GDP, Global 
  Economy</span></p>
<p>In the Global Economy scenario there is a strong decline in the share of agriculture 
  in GDP. The decline is much more pronounced than in the regional communities 
  scenario (see, next graph). The decline is lowest in the central part of Europe 
  and highest along the borders of the EU (Eastern Europe and parts of Southern 
  and Northern Europe).<br>

  <br>
  In Eastern and Southern Europe many regions might have problems to cope with 
  the decline of agriculture in their region. </p>
<p><img src="images/regions_leading7.jpg" width="496" height="406"><br>
  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 6 - Regional clusters, Regional Communities</span></p>
<p>Like in the Global economy scenario many of the regions that might have problems 
  to cope with the decline of agriculture in their region are regions in Eastern 
  and Southern Europe. However, the problems are less severe in the regional communities 
  scenario.</p>
