<b>The EU has several spatial explicit policies implemented. Examples are 
the designation of the High Nature Value farmlands (HNV), of the Natura 2000 areas, 
of Nitrogen Vulnerable Zones (NVZ) and of Less Favoured Areas (LFA). </b> 
<p><b>In this sheet Eururalis results for 2030 are combined with these EU 
  maps. The following combinations have been made:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li><b><a href="#1">LFA with agricultural abandonment to see where LFA 
    policy is effective &#8211; under modeled conditions - and where it is not;</a></b></li>
  <li><b><a href="#2">HNV areas with agricultural abandonment to see where 
    HNVfarmlands are threatened;</a></b></li>
  <li> <b><a href="#3">Natura 2000 areas and the biodiversity index indicator

    2000 areas. </a></b></li>
</ol>
<p><b><a name="1" id="1"></a>1. LFA and agricultural abandonment</b><br>
  In figure 1 a combined map is presented overlaying LFA areas and agricultural 
  abandonment for the Global Coordination, Continental Market and Regional Communities 
  scenarios. In these scenarios it is assumed that current LFA policies will be 
  continued. Areas with agricultural abandonment are projected to change from 
  agricultural land use types into (semi-)natural land cover. The change of agricultural 
  area into urban land-use is not regarded as agricultural abandonment. <br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 1 &#8211; Combination of LFA policy map with 
  agricultural abandonment in 2030 in 1, 2 or 3 scenario&#8217;s. </span><br>
  . <br>
  Results show that agricultural abandonment occurs both inside and outside the 
  designated LFA areas. Model calculations have assumed EU-wide that LFA payments 
  compensate the unfavourable conditions of a location to an extent equal to 20% 
  of the difference in suitabily between the most and least productive locations 
  within Europe. The occurrence of land abandonment within the LFA areas indicates 
  that apparently this compensation is not enough to prevent abandonment from 
  happening in the LFA areas. Striking is the shift of abandonment to the edges 
  just outside of LFA areas. These areas do not get the payment but have, as compared 
  to the most suitable regions not very favourable conditions for agricultural 
  production. <br>
  <br>
  Below some detailed examples show the potential developments for a number of 
  EU regions. </p>
<p><img src="images/whatabout_overlay2.jpg" width="376" height="309"></p>
<p><em>Central Italy:</em><br>
  Central Italy is one of the regions that is facing large areas of land abandonment.<br>
  <br>
  C and D: Land abandonment in the very marginal areas (mountainous areas) will 
  continue in spite of LFA compensation.<br>
  A and B: While inside the LFA area the LFA compensation helps farmers to overcome 
  the negative conditions, areas that are just outside the LFA areas will be abandoned, 
  because given the LFA compensation in the LFA areas, these are now the areas 
  that are the least interesting to farm.</p>
<p><img src="images/whatabout_overlay3.jpg" width="384" height="318"> </p>
<p><em>North Poland:</em><br>
  A. - LFA policies push land abandonment to the areas just outside the LFA areas.<br>
  B. - Some of the areas within the LFA areas will not also face land abandonment 
  in spite of the LFA compensation. The conditions are too marginal.</p>
<p><img src="images/whatabout_overlay4.jpg" width="381" height="321"></p>
<p><em>Portugal</em><br>
  A: Some of the marginal areas within the LFA loose agriculture in spite of LFA 
  compensation.<br>
  B: Outside the LFA areas some areas will be abandoned because the conditions 
  are not favourable either or cannot compete with farmers inside the LFA areas 
  that receive compensation<br>
  C: No abandonment will occur in these LFA areas. </p>
<p><img src="images/whatabout_overlay5.jpg" width="384" height="324"></p>
<p> <em>South-Central France</em><br>
  A and B: In France large areas in the LFA zone will be abandoned in spite of 
  LFA compensation<br>
  C: On the edges of LFA regions farmers without LFA compensation will quit farming<br>
  D: Area with marginal agricultural conditions in Italy (Monferrato) without 
  LFA protection. Agriculture is likely to be abandoned unless specific products 
  or other rural development options are implemented; currently agriculture is 
  focused on wine production which is less sensitive to the unfavourable conditions 
  for other crops.</p>
<p><img src="images/whatabout_overlay6.jpg" width="383" height="320"></p>
<p><em>Sweden</em><br>
  A and D: The small and marginal agricultural part will be abandoned. Overall 
  many open agricultural enclaves disappear leading to more homogeneous landscapes. 
  <br>
  B: Some parts in the central part of Sweden will remain under agricultural use<br>
  C: Some large areas of agriculture will be abandoned even if there is LFA subsidy<br>
  E: Abandonment is pushed out of the LFA area to the more favourable agricultural 
  areas. LFA compensation in this case has a trade-of for the most productive 
  region of Sweden. In the part of the region where LFA compensation applies agriculture 
  will not be abandoned.</p>
<p><b><a name="2"></a>2. HNV &amp; agricultural abandonment</b><br>
  In figure 1 the High Nature Value farmlands (HNV) are indicated. In these areas 
  extensive and often traditional farming methods contribute to the biodiversity 
  and the attractiveness of the landscape. Loss of agricultural land-use would 
  mean loss of these extensive farming landscapes because natural succession will 
  in the end transform these areas to either forest or shrub vegetation. <br>
  <br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 2a &#8211; Areas with the High Nature Value 
  farmland status</span></p>
<p><em>Agricultural abandonment </em><br>
  Technological progress resulting in higher yields will result in a surplus of 
  agricultural land in the EU27 in most scenarios. In figure 2b the location of 
  agricultural abandonment is illustrated in two maps. The yellow color shows 
  abandoned land outside HNV areas, whereas the red color indicates agricultural 
  abandonment within HNV areas. </p>
<p>To illustrate the impact of the scenarios two scenarios with a significant 
  agricultural abandonment are highlighted: Global Economy and Global Cooperation. 
  In Global Economy about 12% of the EU27 agricultural area will be abandoned; 
  in Global Co-operation this is 14%. </p>

<p>Both maps show significant agricultural abandonment. In Global Economy the

</p>
<p><b><a name="3" id="3"></a>3. Natura 2000 &amp; biodiversity</b><br>
  Natura2000 policy is implemented to safeguard and develop nature areas in Europe. 
  In figure 3a the Natura 2000 areas are illustrated. Figure 3b shows the development 
  of the biodiversity index for the Continental Market and the Global Coordination 
  scenario. Red areas on the map mean a decline of biodiversity and green areas 
  show an increase of biodiversity between 2000 and 2030. Grey areas are relatively 
  stable concerning their biodiversity index. The general picture shows a far 
  more positive future under Global Coordination conditions.<br>

<p><em>Romania, Poland an Slovakia</em><br>
  In figure 3c a more detailed picture is given to indicate the consequences for 
  the Natura 2000 areas in a part of Eastern Europe. The maps show clear differences 
  between both scenarios. Again the Continental Market scenario shows more red 
  indicating a larger decline of biodiversity. Still also in the Global Coordination 
  scenarios biodiversity is under pressure in many Natura 2000 areas. Different 
  reasons are applicable depending on the specific locations: abandonment of extensive 
  pasture systems, urbanization or reclaiming natural vegetation for farming.

<p><em>Spain and Portugal</em><br>
  Biodiversity is more stable in the Natura 2000 areas on the Iberian Peninsula. 
  Though both in Continental Market and Global Cooperation large red areas appear 
  on the map indicating a decline of the biodiversity index. Both scenarios show 
  a similar pattern of decrease. In the Cooperation scenario next to decreasing 
  hotspots there are also areas with more positive developments for biodiversity.
