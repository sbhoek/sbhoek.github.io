  Highlights <br>
  World wide crop land area will expand with almost 25% towards 2030. This trend 
  is opposite of the EU27 &#8211; especially EU15 - developments, which shows 
  a stable or declining agricultural area. </strong></p>
<p><strong>World wide agricultural expansion is largest in the Global Economy 
  scenario. This will lead to most pressure on planet indicators such as biodiversity, 
  erosion and carbon sequestration. Positive developments in Europe in the Global 
  Economy scenario come alongside with extra pressure elsewhere on the globe. 
  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Especially in developing countries agriculture will expand. This will 
  have a strong impact in their environment. Main drivers behind this increase 
  are economic growth, liberalization, population growth and the introduction 
  of the fist generation of biofuels. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The introduction of bio-energy crops will raise the pressure on the 
  land. Especially in the world regions Brazil, the US and West Africa the impact 
  of bio-energy directive will be noticeable.</strong></p>

  <strong>Globalization versus Ecosystems</strong><br>
  Although Eururalis focuses on Europe, the scenarios cannot be seen without the 
  global context. On the global scale most radical changes in land-use are expected 
  in the developing countries, since the economic growth is highest in these scenarios. 
  Moreover, liberalization will have a major impact on exporting regions like 
  South America and Australia. The expansion of agricultural land in regions like 
  Latin America, Africa and Asia is possible, but at the cost of natural vegetation.<br>

<p>Because of high economic activities, Global Economy results in high pressure 
  on the land and consequently at the ecosystems, whereas an economic less active 
  world like Continental Market shows lower pressures. This is the global picture. 
</p>
<p>Here, the results confirm that the pressure on the ecosystems through high 
  economic activities and a large increase in arable land expansion can be very 
  high as a result of increasing economic wealth that goes together with globalization. 
</p>
<p>In a total analysis of liberalization, these kinds of drawbacks for the environmental 
  system should be considered too. In the liberalizing scenario Global Co-operation, 
  in which there is strong notion of environmental problems, the pressures on 
  the environment can be lowered by implementing policies on persisting environmental 
  problems like climate change (in Global Co-operation stringent climate policies 
  are implemented). Consequently, a big increase of arable land is combined with 
  lower pressures on the remaining natural vegetation. </p>
<p>In the Regional Communities scenario, the lowest impacts are expected because 
  of the low economic activities and environmental focus. However, economically 
  the Regional Communities scenario leads to less beneficial conclusions. <br>
  Liberalisation versus market protection</p>
<p>As shown in figures 1a-c crop area can increase drastically in different regions 
  in the world. As expected the USA profits from the market protection in the 
  transatlantic market of scenario Continental Market, while the opposite effect 
  is visible for Brazil. From Figure 1, it becomes clear that Africa will experience 
  a major increase in agricultural land in each scenario, being a result of the 
  expected population increase in Africa in the coming 30 years. Moreover, changes 
  in diet towards more meat also contributes to a further increase of land for 
  grass to feed the animals. <br>
  Further, Latin America and Oceania show a large difference between liberalized 
  scenarios (Global Economy and Global Co-operation) and regionalized scenarios 
  (Continental Market and Regional Communities). This is shown in Figure 1b for 
  Brazil. </p>
<p><strong>Introducing biofuels</strong><br>
  Interesting is also to look at the impact of the introduction of the first generation 
  of bio-energy. This is shown in figure 2 for Global Economy scenario with different 
  options of the ambition of stimulating bio-energy. Similar to figure 1 there 
  is a large increase in crop areas for the developing regions Africa and Latin 
  America, even increasing for the scenario variants that include biofuels. </p>
