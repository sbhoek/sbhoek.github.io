  Highlights<br>
  Nitrogen surpluses in most of the EU regions in general are below 100 kg per
  agricultural hectare per year.<br>
  <br>
  Regions with intensive livestock production such as the Netherlands, Ireland,
  Northern Italy, Malta and Brittany show higher surpluses.<br>
  <br>
  In future nitrogen surpluses show a declining trend in the EU15, mainly due
  to lower fertilizer input. Oppositely in the EU12 - small - increases of nitrogen
  surpluses can be seen, driven by both growth of the livestock sector and higher
  fertilizer consumption over time.<br>
  Nitrogen is an essential plant nutrient. The main sources of nitrogen for a
  crop are fertilizer, manures, biological N fixation, and atmospheric deposition.
  However, if the input of nitrogen via fertilizers and manures to a crop exceeds
  the output via harvested product, the surplus of nitrogen is lost to the environment.<br>
  <br>
  Part of the nitrogen is lost as harmful compounds, such as ammonia and nitrous
  oxide and nitrate. The nitrogen surplus is an indicator for the loss of nitrogen
  to the environment.<br>
  <br>
  The calculations of the values of this indicator are based on a preliminary
  methodology and data. Improvement of the methods and underlying data is still in
  progress. The results therefore should be interpreted carefully and only to
  assess the broad patterns and changes between scenarios and policy options.

  <b>Past developments</b><br>
  In intensive agricultural systems in North West Europe, the nitrogen surplus
  has strongly increased in the period 1950-1980 because increasing numbers of
  livestock and increased use of artificial fertilizers. In seventies and eighties,
  negative effects of the high surplus of nitrogen became visible. The eutrofication
  of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems increased and nitrate concentrations in
  groundwater frequently exceeded the standards for drinking water. Environmental
  policies in the eighties and nineties environmental policies resulted in stabilization
  and decrease in the nitrogen surplus. The figure shows the trend in nitrogen
  surplus in the Netherland, showing low nitrogen surplus in the beginning of
  the 20th century, the increase in the period 1950-1985 and the decrease after
  1990.<br>
  In the extensive agricultural systems in Central Europe, nitrogen surplus is
  small and has even decreased in the nineties, because the economical situation
  did not allow to use much fertilizers.<br>

  <b>Future developments</b><br>
  In the high regulation scenarios Regional Communities and Global Cooperation
  livestock production will rather stable in the EU27. An increase of livestock
  production can be observed in the EU12 and decreases in the Low Countries, Portugal
  and Italy. Together with lower inputs of fertilizer over time for cropping this
  will lead to a smaller N-surplus in general for the EU15. For the EU12 slightly
  higher animal production in combination with higher fertilizer use will lead
  to an increase of N-surpluses in the EU12.<br>
  <br>
  In the low regulation scenarios Global Economy and Continental Market livestock
  production will grow in general. This is counterbalanced by lower inputs of
  fertilizer over time in cropping systems in the EU15. Although inputs of fertilizer
  are higher in these scenarios compared to Regional Communities and Global Cooperation
  because government regulations are less strict and for the Global Economy scenario
  also the production intensity of farming systems is higher.<br>
  <br>
  Regions that already have high surpluses remain highest for all scenarios.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Most important drivers</b><br>
  The most important drivers of the nitrogen surplus are the growth of the livestock
  production (see also livestock density and livestock production) and the technological
  developments determining the use of artificial fertilizer.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Policy impact</b><br>
  Since the nitrogen surplus of agriculture is to an important degree dependent
  of the livestock density and because of the fact that the livestock density
  indicator is only available for the baseline situations, the maps and figures
  for N-surplus of the policy options should be treated with caution. Improvement
  of the livestock density indicator will enhanced the nitrogen surplus indicator
  in a next version of Eururalis.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Used methodology</b><br>
  The nitrogen surplus of agriculture is calculated on the regional level as the
  differences between the nitrogen inputs via fertilizers, manure, atmospheric
  deposition, and biological nitrogen fixation and the outputs via crop yield
  of nitrogen.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The nitrogen surplus is also used as indicator for the OECD<br>
  (see explanatory notes: <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/11/1916652.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/0/11/1916652.pdf</a>
  ) and the European Commission (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/envir/report/en/nitro_en/report.htm" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/envir/report/en/nitro_en/report.htm</a>
