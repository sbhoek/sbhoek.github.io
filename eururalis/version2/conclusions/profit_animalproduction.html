  <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
  Livestock production in the EU15 stabilizes or declines in Global Cooperation (B1) and Regional Communities (B2) 
  scenarios due to low economic growth and declining preference for animal protein.

  <b>Future developments</b><br>
  Livestock production growth is low in the EU relative to other countries. Lower 
  demographic and economic growth are important explanations. In the EU15 and 
  other high income countries meat consumption declines due to preference shift 
  in diet, especially in the Global Cooperation and Regional Communities scenarios. For the EU10 (and developing 
  countries) this effect is smaller: higher income leads to higher consumption.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Policy effects</b><br>
  Production growth of products with protection of CAP is lower than for other 
  agricultural products in all scenarios. Reduction of border support has a significant 
  negative impact in the global scenario's (Global Economy and Global Cooperation) where all border support 
  is abolished. The impact is less severe in the Regional Communities scenario where all export 
  subsidies are abolished. However, the reduction of output for protected commodities 
  in Regional Communities can largely be explained by the reduction of border support because there 
  is no ofsetting impact of high income growth.<br>
