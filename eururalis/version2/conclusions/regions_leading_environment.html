  Approximately 50% of the land surface of the EU27 is agricultural land. In a 
  number of regions environmental problems related to agriculture occur. In figure 
  1 various environmental issues are presented in one overview map.<br>

  <br>
  Conclusions that can be drawn from map 1 are that agri-environmental issues 
  such as abandonment, urbanization pressure, livestock pressure on the environment 
  and erosion are concentrated in regions in the EU15. </b></p>
<p><b>The Mediterranean countries face mainly the problems of land-abandonment 
  and erosion, whereas Northwestern Europe has to deal with high pressure from 
  urbanization and livestock. In Scandinavia abandonment of agricultural enclaves 
  in large forest areas will lead to disappearance of open landscapes. </b></p>
