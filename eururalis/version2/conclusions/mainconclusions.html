<b>Future of the EU will be shaped by global forces</b><br>
The future of Europe&#8217;s rural areas is for an important extent shaped by 
more or less autonomous global driving forces. Especially the development of (global) 
demography and macro economic growth outline the trends for rural Europe. These 
driving forces set the demand for food and fuel and will shape the opportunities 
and threats of EU regions. EU policies can smoothen or speed up these global trends. 
Especially for issues such as farm income, farm structure and agricultural abandonment 
EU policies on CAP and bio-energy make a difference. 
<p><b>Changing role of farming</b><br>
  The total agricultural production in the EU remains more or less intact in all 
  scenarios. The importance of farming for the total economy is already small 
  in the EU15 (old member states). In the EU12 (new member states) the significance 
  for the economy will decline rapidly over time for all scenarios towards the 
  level of the EU15, leading to a significant decrease in agricultural employment. 
  Farming remains above all important for the use and management of the land and 
  the environment. </p>
<p><strong>Agricultural abandonment depends on liberalization and bio-energy </strong><br>
  In all scenarios but the Continental Market scenario the EU27 faces significant 
  land abandonment by agriculture. Especially the liberalization scenarios Global 
  Economy and Global Cooperation show large scale abandonment (10-12% of total 
  agricultural area until 2030) .This is a continuation of trends in the past. 
  Especially the marginal areas in the EU15 will be affected. Although policies 
  do not turn the historic trend completely, more support of the CAP and stimulation 
  of bio-energy crops will reduce the amount of abandoned land by more then 50%. 
</p>
<p><b>EU12 catches up, but remains behind</b><br>
  Structural changes in the EU12 are larger than in the old member states. Because 
  of that the EU12 catches up with the EU15, although it remains behind for farm 
  income and GDP per capita. In this process of change a large amount of agricultural 
  labour will be freed. The question is whether the rest of the economy in the 
  EU12 can absorb all this surplus labour? When looking at the overall growth 
  of the EU12 economies this will probably not be the case for the majority of 
  regions in the EU12. </p>
<p><b>Livestock shift might help to meet environmental targets</b><br>
  In Europe a number of hotspot regions of livestock production are present. These 
  hotspots are an environmental risk, where strict implementation of environmental 
  policies on for instance nitrogen and water quality is needed to prevent (or 
  stop) pollution of air, soil and water. Concentration of livestock in certain 
  regions can be however logic from an economic point of view, since it facilitates 
  an efficient supply chain. There are also regions with very low livestock rates. 
  In these regions livestock might enhance farmers income. In regions with a high 
  production of arable crops additional livestock might create opportunities for 
  a more closed nutrient cycling. </p>
<p><b>Large impact of bio-energy policy</b><br>
  The EU-biofuel directive will not be met in al 4 scenarios without additional 
  policies. Substantial subsidies are necessary to reach the 5.75% fuel consumption 
  target in 2010. The impact of such a policy to reach 5.75% will be large. Due 
  to this policy the aggregate income from farmers agricultural employment and 
  the contribution of agriculture to GDP will increase slightly. Most important 
  aspect is the impact on the production of biofuels and land-use. For the EU27 
  about 4% of total land and about 8% of agricultural land will be used to grow 
  first generation bio-energy crops. Erosion, carbon sequestration and biodiversity 
  will be negatively influenced by the increased demand for energy crops. The 
  biofuel directive leads to a relatively large production growth in Brazil which 
  induces higher farm incomes, higher land use and related negative implications 
  for biodiversity. </p>
<p><b>Changes in CAP policies imply higher income and less production effects 
  </b><br>
  The change in the CAP policy from market price support to income support leads 
  to relatively minor changes in agricultural production, but to more profound 
  changes in agricultural income, land prices and farm structure if CAP policies 
  are abolished. Reduction of both income support and market support will cause 
  a decline in agricultural income. The impact of income support on income is 
  most substantial. In contrast to the EU15 the EU12 shows an increase of agricultural 
  income due to production growth and the accession effect until 2010. </p>
<p><b>A positive future for EU27.&#8230;.</b><br>
  Farm income and the number of farmers will decline, but in general many indicators 
  develop in a positive way for the EU27. Overall GDP is growing in all scenarios, 
  agricultural production is maintained although on a smaller area of agricultural 
  land. Also the target of replacing 5.75 percent of fossil fuel with bio-energy 
  from crops can be reached and in most scenarios erosion decreases, biodiversity 
  will grow and carbon sequestration goes up. </p>
<p><b>&#8230; but regional differences remain large</b><br>
  Unless these positive overall EU27 developments, many regions are still facing 
  problems in the future. In general rural regions in the EU12 are still lagging 
  behind on socio-economic aspects. The structural change of agricultural production 
  will lead to a labour surplus that probably cannot be absorbed by the regions 
  itself. In marginal regions of the EU15 land abandonment will occur on an extensive 
  scale. As a consequence open farmland landscapes will disappear as well as accompanying 
  specific habitats and valued landscapes. Although improvements are observed 
  a large number of regions still lag behind concerning environmental issues as 
  erosion, biodiversity loss and large nutrients surpluses.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>European policies can impact global targets substantially </strong><br>
  The CAP reform is shifting agricultural production to large food exporting regions like 
  Brazil because of cost minimization. However, cost minimization of production is not 
  necessarily equal to the lowest environmental pressure on land. In Eururalis it is shown 
  that full trade liberalization leads to a global increase of agricultural land, 
  resulting in biodiversity loss in regions like Latin America. Moreover, the introduction 
  of a Biofuel Directive will have also global consequences. In a liberalized world, more 
  than 60% of the biofuels are imported from outside Europe, of which around 40% comes from 
  Brazil. The coinciding land-use impact will further deteriorate global biodiversity 
  outcomes, worsening the chances to meet the global biodiversity target. These external 
  impacts of EU policies could be taken into account in future CAP and biofuel discussions.
</p>
<p><b>Need for policy coherence on different scales</b><br>
  On at least three scale levels there is an important role for policy to enhance 
  sustainable development of rural Europe. On the global level, climate change 
  and trade liberalization ask for attention. On the EU27 and the national level, 
  the future of sustainable agriculture in relations to land management and socio-economic 
  aspects should be discussed in relation to the CAP reform. On the regional level 
  the opportunities and threats coming from the higher scales should be addressed 
  with a fit rural development strategy. A specific rural development strategy 
  per region is needed to take into account the large differences between regions. 
  Understanding the interaction of policy on different scales is essential for 
  good governance.</p>
