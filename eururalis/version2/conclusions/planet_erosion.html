  <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
  Two counteracting processes affect dynamics in soil erosion by water: on the
  one hand declines in agricultural land lead to a reduction of soil erosion,
  on the other hand climate change leads to an increase in soil erosion.
  <br>
  In most scenarios the erosion-mitigating effects of land abandonment are
  compensating the negative effects of increased and more erratic rainfall, so
  that a net decrease in soil erosion in Europe is the result for all scenarios.
  <br>
  The absolute decrease is particularly strong in the EU15 member states, where
  erosion rates are currently still quite high. The relative decrease is strongest
  in the EU10, but here erosion rates are already low due to the intrinsic low
  erosion-proneness of Poland and the Baltic States.</b>

<p><b>Past developments</b><br>
  To a large extent, soil erosion has determined the way Europe looks. The marginality
  of soils in the Mediterranean basin, resulting from severe erosion in ancient and
  medieval times, has put a strong footprint on this area. Even when correcting for the
  periodical water deficit in these semi-arid areas, the reduced water holding and
  infiltration capacity of the eroded soils significantly contribute to the low
  productivity of agriculture. In northern Europe, erosion has also been severe, but
  the effects have been less pronounced due to the deeper soils. Iceland forms an
  important exception, and has often been mentioned as an example of a society that has
  been strongly hindered by the negative effects of soil erosion.
  <br>
  Within shorter timescales, and in more recent times, erosion has been subject
  to a declining trend due to favorable land use changes. In Figure 2, erosion
  in four erosion-prone areas in Europe over the last 50 years is shown. In general,
  a decrease in agriculture in marginal, erosion-prone areas causes the overall
  decline.<br>
  At the same time, other processes, related to land use intensification, have
  played a conversed role: increasing parcel size, deeper and faster plowing,
  multiple harvests per year have all lead to increasing soil erosion. Moreover,
  climate change has not affected erosion trends of the past, which shows to become
  increasingly important in the future.<br>

  <br>
  <b>Future developments</b><br>
  Scenarios that show a strong decline in agriculture, generally also show the largest
  decrease in soil erosion. The effect of climate change differs per region. In the Alps
  an increased erosivity is foreseen whereas in Southern Europe a decrease in rainfall
  erosivity is foreseen. In the Continental Market scenario the decrease in erosion is smallest 
  because of a relatively small decrease in erosivity in the Mediterranean zone on the one hand,
  and the limited land abandonment on the other hand. In the scenarios Regional Communities and
  Global Cooperation the reduction in erosion is strongest, which is due to land abandonment 
  (particularly in B1) and due to a reduction of rainfall erosivity in the Mediterranean area 
  (particularly in B2).

<p><b>Policy effects</b><br>
  The support of (liquid) biofuel production in Europe leads to higher erosion rates,
  as the cultivated (i.e. ploughed) area increases (table x). The difference between
  medium and high biofuel ambition only affects the EU15 countries, whereas the
  difference between low and medium ambition affects the entire EU.
</p>
<p>Also the stimulation of agricultural practices in mountainous areas, by means of the
  Less Favoured Areas scheme, enhances soil erosion (table x), but this effect is quite
  small, compared to the effect of the biofuel production aims. Maintaining or (partly)
  abolishing the Common Agricultural Policy has some effect on soil erosion, as it
  controls to an important extent the degree of land abandonment.

<b>Most important drivers</b><br>
Soil erosion is driven by land use and climate change. The land use change is in part driven by
agricultural reform and global trade, and in part by increasing urbanization due to population
and welfare growth. Mainly the abandonment of agricultural land has compensated for the detrimental
increase in rainfall erosivity.<br>
Rainfall erosivity has generally increased in the temperate zone, because the distribution of
rainfall throughout the year has become more irregular (i.e. more drought and more rainfall
events). The dry periods hinder vegetation growth and soil formation, so that the heavy,
intensive storms can induce severe erosion events. In the Mediterranean countries, rainfall
erosivity has decreased, enhancing the positive effect of land abandonment on the reduction
in soil erosion.
<br>
<br>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
On the continental scale erosion is subject to a decreasing trend. No account has been taken
of changing cultivation practices: this means that erosion may be underestimated because of
intensified practices, but it also means that no erosion-mitigating practices were included,
such as contour-ploughing, or the establishment of grass strips, hedges, and so forth.
<br>
A last remark should be made to the coarse resolution and the relative applicability of the
USLE-method at such coarse scales. As erosion is highly variable at local scales, the presented
maps should be interpreted with caution: the higher the aggregation level, the more reliable the
data is. It is, however, not meant to zoom in to pixel-level to see what will happen in your or
someone else's backyard.
<br>
<br>
<b>Used methodology</b><br>
Soil erosion is calculated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) principle, based on
topography, rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility and protective vegetation cover. Stoniness
of soils is incorporated to avoid overestimations of soil erosion of already degraded
Mediterranean soils.
<br>
Within the time-span of the Eururalis project, topography and soil erodibility are considered
constant in time. Rainfall erosivity, however, varies due to climate change (both the total
annual rainfall amount and the irregularity of rainfall throughout the year), while the
protective vegetation cover is obviously a function of land use.
<br>
The dynamic rainfall erosivity and vegetation cover variables are computed for each scenario.
A soil erosion map is obtained by multiplying these variables with maps of topography and soil
erodibility. Based on this map a relative difference in erosion risk compared to the year 2000
is computed at HARM level, while the map can also be viewed in a reclassed form on pixel level
to indicate overall erosion risk.
