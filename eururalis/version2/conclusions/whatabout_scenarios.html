  Because the future is uncertain, EUruralis 2.0 is built on four scenarios. Key 
  driving forces within scenarios are political developments on both European 
  and global scales, macro-economic growth and demographic developments. Other 
  important drivers are technology, climate change and consumer behaviour. EU 
  and national policies are also important. </b></p>
<p>The four scenarios also relate to different plausible developments defined 
  by two axes. The vertical axis symbolizes a global approach as opposed to a 
  more regional approach to problems and strategies. The horizontal axis represents 
  market-orientation versus a higher level of governmental intervention. This 
  results in four scenarios illustrated in figure 1.</p>

<p><b>Demography</b><br>
  Depending on the scenario, in the period 2000-2030 Europe's (EU27) population 
  will grow slightly, as in Global Economy and in Global Cooperation, or decrease 
  as in Continental Markets and Regional Communities. In all scenarios the average 
  age of the population will rise sharply</p>

  scenarios</span></p>
<p><b>Macro-economic growth</b><br>
  Income is an important driver. Growth of income affects the future of rural 
  areas directly and indirectly in a variety of ways. GDP is assumed to grow in 
  all scenarios for all continents. GDP growth per capita is a measure of income 
  increase. Between the scenarios there are significant differences in the rate 
  of growth. In general the Global Economy scenario shows the highest growth rates. 
  Asia shows the highest growth rates of the groups of countries.<br>
  The income growth rate in EU12 countries is higher than in EU15 countries in 
  all scenarios, especially in the Global Cooperation scenario.<br>
