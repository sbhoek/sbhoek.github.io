  <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
  Total livestock numbers will decrease slightly over time in all scenarios for
  the EU27.<br>
  <br>
  </b><b>In general the EU15 member states show a decrease in almost
  all livestock over time with a bigger decline for land-based livestock and a
  slighter decline for land-less livestock.<br>
  <br>
  For the new member states an increase is calculated for Global Economy (A1),
  Continental Market (A2) and Global Cooperation (B1), mainly for cattle and poultry,
  less for sheep, goats and pigs. An overall increase in livestock demand is only
  expected in Global Economy (A1).<br>
  <br>
  Livestock production is found everywhere in Europe. Highest concentrations of
  livestock per square kilometer of agricultural land are found in The Netherlands,
  Malta, Belgium, Britanny, Northern Italy, Northeastern parts of Spain, Denmark
  and Ireland. This is mainly due to the historic presence of intensive livestock
  systems especially for poultry and pigs.<br>
  <br>
  Results show that livestock will remain concentrated. This will almost certainly
  conflict with environmental legislation (Nitrates Directive, Water Framework
  Directive, etc). Even in the Strong Europe and Regional Communities scenarios
  where more strict environmental legislation is implemented in the model, livestock
  density conflicts with environmental targets.<br>
  <br>
  The demands for livestock are mainly economically driven. Implementation of
  strict environmental policies will shifts in livestock have to be much stronger
  that predicted. In many regions simply is not enough agricultural land available
  to meet the lower livestock densities demanded by environmental targets.<br>
  <br>
  The calculations of the values of this indicator are based on a preliminary
  methodology and data. Improvement of the methods and underlying data is still in
  progress. The results therefore should be interpreted carefully and only to
  assess the broad patterns and changes between scenarios and policy options.

  <b>Past developments</b><br>
  In the EU12 livestock numbers, expressed in livestock units were rather stable
  in the period from 1990 to 2000, but this is not equally distributed between
  the different livestock types. The number of livestock units of cattle and sheep
  decreased. The livestock units of pigs, on the other hand, increased during
  by 14.5% between 1990 and 2000 (EU12).<br>
  In Eastern Europe numbers of livestock have fallen by about 50%. Main reason
  for this was the economic restructuring in the 1990s.<br>
  Distinct regional differences in livestock patterns are apparent from the Farm
  Structure Survey data. Cattle production is dominant in the majority of the
  administrative regions, whereas pig production is dominant in specific regions,
  such as northeast Spain, The Netherlands, Flanders and Brittany. Sheep is dominant
  in the highland regions of Scotland and Wales, as well as in central Spain.
  Only in Denmark, Spain increases of over 10% of livestock units are seen in
  the period 1990-2000 (Source Irena IFS 13).<br>
  <br>
  <b>Future developments</b><br>
  In the Global Economy (A1) and Continental Markets (A2) scenarios most increase
  in livestock numbers is found through intensification at regions that are currently
  most intensively used for livestock. However, in some of the most densely populated
  regions some spread toward other areas is seen due to reaching the maximum livestock
  densities that are possible given logistics and disease risk. Locations especially
  easily accessible from harbours for imported feed but also towns for processing
  industry and consumers are preferred as new locations for intensive livestock
  production in the global orientated scenarios Global Economy (A1) and Global
  Cooperation (B1).<br>
  <br>
  In the Global Cooperation (B1) and Regional Communities (B2) scenarios spread
  from the most densely populated regions towards regions with high development
  potential is seen. In the Global Cooperation scenario this effect is strongest
  in the nitrate vulnerable zones where policy measures are assumed to have drastically
  limited the maximum stocking rates. In the Regional Communities scenario this
  spread is not only limited to the nitrate vulnerable zones: both environmental,
  animal welfare considerations and preference for less intensive systems lead
  to more spread of livestock throughout the countries.<br>

  scenarios</span><br>
  <br>
  The biggest dynamics in the EU15 member states in terms of total changes per
  livestock category between the initial year and 2030 are calculated for the
  Continental Market scenario. The new EU member states, contrary, will hardly
  show significant changes in livestock demand in this scenario.<br>
  The biggest dynamics for the new member states can be expected in a globalized
  world with low governmental interventions, low trade barriers and no strict
  environmental policies (Global Economy scenario).<br>
  <br>
  <b>Policy impact</b><br>
  Income support as instruvment of the CAP has a direct impact on the livestock
  demand. The Global Economy (A1) scenarios consider two different options with
  respect to future changes of income support, either an abolishment or a strong
  decrease of income support of 50%. These two rather similar income support options
  can cause big differences in livestock demand. In the new member states the
  abolishment of income support leads to a more rapid decrease of demand compared
  to the demand decrease in the decreasing income support scenario. The development
  in the old member states can be expected to be slightly different. The abolishment
  of income support leads in most of the old member states to an increase of dairy
  cattle demand but the demand remains more or less stable for the other livestock
  types. Assuming a decreasing income support (but no abolishment) lead to a decrease
  of all livestock types in the old member states. In the scenarios Global Cooperation 
  and Regional Communities changes in income support have a much lower impact on the 
  livestock demand. The strongest impact of income support reduction is calculated for 
  the pig and poultry sector of the old EU member states where a decrease of income 
  support can cause an up to 8% lower demand compared to the increasing income support 
  scenario. This can be traced back to the high preference for local products and the 
  strong protection of the food industry from outside competition.v The policy options
  on LFA and Biofuels do not show any or any clear effect on livestock demand.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Most important drivers</b><br>
  Changes in livestock numbers in Europe as a whole and between the different
  member states are mainly driven by the consumer demand for livestock products,
  production costs and policies on global trade of meat and dairy products. Within
  countries the spatial distribution of livestock was, historically, mainly driven
  by environmental parameters, such as climate, soil suitability, land use, slope
  and distance from consumer locations.<br>
  <br>
  Whereas the spatial distribution of land-based livestock keeping is still largely
  based on the spread of pasture areas, the most important location considerations
  for land-less systems are the competitive advantage of the region in terms of
  logistics (feed availability trough e.g., harbours, and processing industries)
  and environmental considerations related to manure and disease risk. Changes
  in land use policies aiming at reducing negative environmental impacts as well
  as changes in demand for animal products, either from local consumers or international
  trade are assumed to strongly influence the spatial livestock distribution in
  the future. From the results it is clear that policies limiting the maximum
  livestock numbers in a region are a main driver for changing spatial distributions.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Discussion</b><br>
  Livestock is a new indicator in the Eururalis framework. In the modeling process
  many challenges have been encountered. The environmental boundaries coming from
  legislation are not yet fully implemented in the model. In a next version of
  Eururalis that will be an important topic. Larger spread of livestock might
  then be expected. This will have an influence on many other indicators.<br>
  The results clearly show that regional concentrations of livestock exist. These
  concentrations of livestock potentially conflict with environmental targets.
  Livestock production influences also many other - planet - indicators (in)directly:
  erosion by overgrazing, biodiversity, nitrogen emissions and gaseous emissions
  of ammonia, etc.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Used methodology</b><br>
  The demand for each livestock type is calculated with GTAP and IMAGE. GTAP is
  applied to calculate livestock goods and services for consumption considering
  bilateral livestock commodity trade. The GTAP output is used by IMAGE to calculate
  how many animals are needed to meet this production and how much feed they need.
  The amount of feed determines the size of pastureland, which is in line with
  the number of animals and therefore the amount of animal production and consumption.
  Given specific diet assumptions in IMAGE, i.e. how much pasture and how much
  crops are needed by the animals, the area of pastureland is determined.<br>
  Initial and future livestock distribution:<br>
  In order to assess changes in the spatial distribution of livestock in relation
  to land use change a map of the initial livestock distribution map has been
  developed based on census data at the level of NUTS1 or NUTS2 regions. A further
  downscaling was made based on reported livestock densities on different land
  use and (assumed) location preferences. A major distinction is made between
  different animal types: dairy cows, meat cows, sheep and goats are assumed to
  be highly dependent on local land resources for grazing or feed production,
  pigs and poultry are assumed to be mainly land independent animal husbandry
  systems.<br>
  A spatial livestock distribution model has been developed to distribute, within
  the different countries, the simulated changes in livestock numbers. The change
  of livestock numbers is simulated by considering the initial livestock distribution,
  land use changes, the carrying capacities of the different land use types, location
  preferences, and prevalent policies under the scenario conditions.<br>
  <br>
  For each of the four different reference scenarios a different, coherent set
  of carrying capacities of the land and different types of spatial dynamics of
  livestock growth are assumed. The 'low regulation', market oriented scenarios
  ("Global Economy" and "Continental Markets" allow for carrying capacities up
  to 4.000 LSU per km<sup>2</sup>  and suppose a future distribution of livestock driven by
  the initial distribution pattern: i.e., as long as the carrying capacities are
  not exceeded it is assumed that most increase in livestock numbers occurs at
  locations that already have high animal densities. In the 'high regulation'
  B-scenarios ("Global Co-operation" and "Regional Communities ") wealth distribution
  and sustainable development play a crucial role which led to the implementation
  of environmental policies, for example Nitrate vulnerable areas. To meet these
  requirements the livestock density is restricted to maximum 700 LSU per km<sup>2</sup> 
  Global Cooperation (B1) and 400 LSU per km<sup>2</sup>  (Regional Communities (B2)). In
  these scenarios the spatial distribution is steered by the available resource
  capacities based on either avoiding pollution of soil and water resources by
  nitrogen or local availability of feed.<br>
