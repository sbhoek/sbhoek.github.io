  <br>
  <em>Explanation</em><br>
  The current CAP expenditures are about 37 billion euro (without rural area payments). 
  In 2030 these expenditures will be zero in the Global Economy (A1) scenario because there 
  is full trade liberalisation and abolishment of all domestic support. In the 
  Global Cooperation (B1) scenario payments are reduced to almost 15 billion euro because all 
  export subsidies will be abolished and only 37.5% of domestic support is sustained. 
  In the Continental Markets (A2) scenario CAP expenditures will be highest (47 
  billion euro) due to accession and export subsidies (refunds) are kept. In the 
  Regional Communities (B2) scenario CAP expenditures are lower than in the Continental 
  markets (A2) scenario because export refunds are abolished. Direct payments 
  are higher in the Regional Communities (B2) scenario than the Continental markets 
  (A2) scenario because these payments increase with 10%. </p>
