<p>The total agricultural income decreases significantly in all scenarios over 
  the coming 30 years. The main reason is the steady fall of product prices. 
  <strong>Income support</strong> (domestic support) will cause a clear increase in 
  agricultural income (figure 1). A higher <strong>market support</strong> (export 
  subsidies and import tariffs) has a much smaller effect on agricultural incomes
  (figure 2).

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 2. Change in agricultural income as influenced 
  by market support</span><a href="#definition" style="text-decoration:none; font-size: larger;">*</a>
</p>
<p>There is a distinct difference in agricultural income between the EU15 and the 
  EU12 (figure 3). The agricultural income will rise in the EU12, while the EU15 
  faces a marked drop in income. The main reasons for the increase in the EU12 
  are the increased production and the introduction of the CAP in 2004. Since 
  the agricultural income of the EU15 is about 90% of the EU27, it dominates the 
  overall results.<br>

<p>
  Figure 4 shows the impact of increasing income support on agricultural employment 
  and sectoral value added in EU12. The difference between no income support and 
  low income support or between low income support and stable income support is 
  between 0.05% and 0.1%. Increasing current income support does not reduce decrease 
  of agricultural employment in EU12. The impact on agricultural income shows the 
  same trend.

<strong>Agricultural production will increase over the next 30 years</strong><br>
<p>
  Agricultural production is especially influenced by macro-economic developments.
  The differences in agricultural production growth between scenarios are much larger 
  than the impact of market support or income support (figure 5). Growth in total 
  agricultural production is higher in EU12 than EU15, especially in Global economy 
  and Global co-operation.

<p><strong>Impact on protected commodities</strong><br>
  Increasing <strong>market support</strong> has especially impact on protected commodities (Figure 6).
  In EU12 production of cattle, grain and sugar is mostly influenced, while in EU15 
  production of oil crops is also sensitive to market support. Sugar production shows 
  the largest differences, due to the extent of protection in current policies. In all
  scenarios the impact of market support is about the same size.<br>

</p>
<p>
  Increasing <strong>domestic support</strong> in EU12 affects the production of cattle, crops, grain, 
  pork &amp; poultry and oil crops in a positive way (Figure 7). In the EU15 the impact
  of domestic support is less. The production of cattle, grain and oil crops is influenced
  in this region.

</p>
<p><b>Impact on land use</b><br>
  In three out of four scenarios, income support will sustain agricultural land by 3 to 10% in 30 years (Figure 8).
  The effect is most marked in the Continental Market scenario. Decrease of agricultural land 
  use in EU12+2 in the Global Economy scenario is especially due to decrease of agricultural land 
  in Bulgaria and Romania. The effect of income support in the EU12 on agricultural land use is positive.
  Impact of market support on agricultural land use is limited.

Domestic income support: Low = no support, high = decreasing support (Global Economy and 
Global Co-operation) or low = decreasing support, high=stable support (Continental market 
and Regional communities); Market support: Low = liberalization, high = decreasing support
(Global Co-operation) or low = decreasing support, high = constant support (Continental 
market and Regional communities).
