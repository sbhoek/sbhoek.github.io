  <b>Highlights<br>
  Growth of crop production is relatively low in the EU25 countries in all scenarios. 
  Despite liberalisation the EU15 countries obtain the highest growth in the Global 
  economy scenario. For EU10 countries growth is highest in the Global Co-operation 
  scenario.</b></p>
<p><b>Production growth of protected products in the EU15 countries is lower 
  than for other agricultural products. Reduction of border support has a higher 
  negative effect than domestic support reduction. In EU12 the regionalization 
  scenarios obtain relatively high growth rates for protected commodities due 
  to enlargement. </b> </p>

  Future developments</b><br>
  Crop production growth is low in the EU relative to other countries/continents. 
  Lower economic growth in combination with a low income elasticity are important 
  in this respect. In the Global scenario's (Global Economy, Global Cooperation) sugar production in the EU 
  will decline substantially (see next figure below). In the Global Cooperation and Regional Communities scenario's 
  crop production is relatively low due to lower demographic and economic growth 
  and less demand for fodder crops due to less meat consumption. These effects 
  are higher for the EU15 than for the EU10.<br>
  <br>
  For countries outside the Transatlantic market in the Continental Markets scenario crop production 
  is lower than in other scenario's due to low economic growth and no enhanced 
  access to Transatlantic market.</p>

  Total Effect and Contribution of Domestic and Border Support and other factors, 
  annual growth rates, 2001-2030<br>
  <br>
  </span>This Figure describes EU15 production growth for protected under CAP 
  (grains, oilseeds, sugar, beef and dairy). For protected products we give the 
  total production effect which is the result of all scenario's assumptions. Furthermore, 
  the isolated contribution of changes in border support, domestic support and 
  all other factors are depicted.<br>
  <br>
  Production growth of products with protection of CAP is lower than for other 
  agricultural products in all scenarios. Reduction of border support has a significant 
  negative impact in the global scenario's (Global Economy and Global Cooperation) where all border support 
  is abolished. The impact is less severe in the Regional Communities scenario where all export 
  subsidies are abolished. However, the reduction of output for protected commodities 
  in Regional Communities can largely be explained by the reduction of border support because there 
  is no ofsetting impact of high income growth.<br>

  EU12 Production of Protected Products: Total Effect and Contribution of Domestic 
  and Border Support and other factors, annual growth rates, 2001-2030</span><br>
  <br>
  This Figure describes EU12 production growth for protected products under CAP 
  (grains, oilseeds, sugar, beef and dairy). For protected products we give the 
  total production effect which is the result of all scenario's assumptions. Furthermore, 
  the isolated contribution of changes in border support, domestic support and 
  all other factors are depicted.<br>
  <br>
  Accession to the European Union has a positive impact on the production of protected 
  commodities in the EU12, especially in Continental Markets and Regional Communities scenarios. In these scenarios 
  production growth of protected products is higher than for non protected products.<br>
  <br>
  The impact of changes in border and domestic support is relatively limited in 
  the liberalisation scenarios compared to the impact in the EU15 (see, Figure 
  P3).<br>
  <br>
  For the regionalisation scenarios (Continental Markets and Regional Communities) the impact of changes in border 
  and domestic support is more important. Benenefits of accession to the EU15 
  are less eroded by liberalisation. CAP payments are not reduced or even increased 
  (Regional Communities) and access of other countries to the EU is not enhanced.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Most important drivers</b><br>
  Macro-economic growth and border support (especially import tariffs)</p>
