        Approximately half of the EU land surface is characterized as nature.

        in the liberalization scenarios. <br>

</b><strong>The increase in natural area manifests itself mainly by an increase 
in forested area. The semi-natural areas decrease a bit in all scenarios. Some 
of these semi natural areas are converted into agriculture, but the main reason 
for the decrease is the conversion (or succession) into forest. </strong> 
<p><strong>Future developments</strong><br>
  Approximately half of the land of the EU27 is characterized as nature. (Semi-)natural 
  land cover types consist mainly of forest and semi natural vegetation (like 
  shrubland and natural grasslands), moors and heathlands. Other types of natural 
  landuse are also included. These are glaciers and snow, sparsely vegetated areas, 
  inland wetlands, salines, etc.<br>

  <br>
  Towards 2030 the total area of land used for nature increases in Europe for 
  all scenarios except for the Continental Markets - A2 - scenario. The increase 
  in natural area is mainly caused by agricultural abandonment which leaves land 
  free for natural vegetation to develop.<br>
  The trends for Europe do not play out the same way for the EU15, the EU10 and 
  the EU2 (Bulgaria and Romania) as can be seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The 
  most striking conclusions from Figure 2 are that the overall increase in natural 
  area in the EU27 in the Global Economy and Global Cooperation scenarios is not 
  observed in the EU10. In the Global Cooperation scenario the EU10 also shows 
  a different trend as compared to the EU15. These differences are mainly due 
  to the extend to which the EU10 countries benefit from CAP policies, especially 
  during the period 2000-2010.<br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 2 - Overview of conversion of land to nature 
  for the four scenarios between 2000 and 2030.</span></p>
<p>In the Global Economy scenario most regions show an increase of land covered 
  by (semi-)natural land cover types. Only regions in parts of Great Britain, 
  Denmark, Bulgaria and Romania show a decrease of land used for nature. In Bulgaria 
  and Romania agricultural area will expand after the decline in the 1990s. </p>
<p>The Continental Market scenario shows a different picture. In large parts of 
  Europe the amount of nature declines. Especially in Western Europe where remaining 
  patches of (semi-)natural vegetation are taken over by urban area or agricultural 
  expansion. </p>
<p>The Global Coordination as well as the Regional Communities scenario in general 
  show an increase of land covered by natural vegetation types. Central Spain, 
  Denmark, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and parts of Romania show a decrease of nature 
  in these scenarios. </p>
<p>The increase in nature is predominantly caused by agricultural abandonment. 
  These areas will, after abandonment, undergo succession and become new (semi-)natural 
  areas. Succession speed is primarily dependent on soil and climate factors; 
  population pressure and grazing regime were also taken into account. A decrease 
  in natural area is caused by urban pressure and agricultural pressure in areas 
  that are highly productive and suitable for agriculture. Especially the rationalization 
  of agriculture and increase in scale of farming may lead, in some areas, to 
  decrease in natural landscape elements and patches of natural vegetation (whereas 
  the general trend for natural area can be positive). This is illustrated in 
  Figure 3 for a small region in which, in a region favourable for agriculture 
  it is clear that in the Global Economy scenario small patches of nature and 
  natural vegetation along rivers and streams disappears. At the same time, natural 
  vegetation increases in the more marginal mountain regions in the northern part 
  of this region. This type of rearrangement of the landscape leads to a separation 
  of land use functions and more specialized agricultural reagions.</p>

<p>The increase in natural area manifests itself mainly by an increase in afforested 
  area. The semi-natural areas decrease a bit in all scenarios. On the one hand 
  some of these areas are converted into agriculture, but the main reason for 
  decrease in semi-natural vegetation is the conversion (succession) into forest.

<p>A decrease in agricultural area does not necessarily mean that no natural areas 
  are lost. The net increase in natural area consists of some areas with a decrease 
  and many areas with an increase in nature (see Figure 3). </p>
<p><strong>Policy effects</strong><br>
  Changes in the area of nature are highly dependent on the net change of agricultural 
  area and urban area. Whereas the growth (or decline) of urban area is not to 
  be steered by policy options of Eururalis the main factor that influences the 
  area of nature is the change of agricultural land use. Abandoned agricultural 
  lands that do not get a new function will be converted to semi-natural area 
  or forest, depending on the invasion and growth rate of semi-natural vegetation 
  and the location of abandonment, i.e., it is unlikely that abandoned farmland 
  near to cities is left to natural succession, recreational use or hobby farming 
  are in these regions a major user of abandoned farmland.</p>
<p>The main policy impacts on the amount of agricultural land are described in 
  the land-use indicator tab. </p>
<p>The CAP policies do have an important influence on natural areas, especially 
  in relation to the quantity of change. More protection of CAP leads in general 
  to less agricultural abandonment and therefore to less nature. <br>
  The biofuels policy has a large impact as well. An increased demand for biofuels 
  will lead to an increase of land needed for biofuel crop production. This in 
  general leads to less agricultural abandonment. Although regional variations 
  are high because of the dominance of biofuel crop cultivation in a small number 
  of countries. </p>
<p><strong>Spatial policies</strong><br>
  The spatial patterns of changes in land covered by natural vegetation is also 
  influenced by several spatial polices. The most important spatial policies influencing 
  the location of nature that were accounted for in the EUruralis simulations 
  are LFA policies, Natura 2000 policy and urban development policies. </p>
<p>LFA policies help agriculture in areas where farming is more difficult. One 
  of the objectives of this policy is to protect valuable landscapes that show 
  a mosaic of agricultural and natural land uses. The LFA policy is in place to 
  keep existing agriculture in marginal areas. Often these areas are a mixed agricultural-natural 
  landscape where it is especially the combination of these land uses that makes 
  the landscape attractive for cultural-historic, ecological and touristic reasons. 
</p>
<p>The Natura 2000 policy prohibits (amongst other things) the development of 
  built-up area in the B scenarios. With a similar land use claim the spatial 
  allocation is different. The urban development policies work in the same direction. 
  In the A scenarios Global Economy and Continental Market urban sprawl is allowed, whereas
  in the B scenarios Regional Communities and Global Cooperation urban development is targeted 
  at compact urbanization.</p>

<p><strong>Most important drivers</strong><br>
  The increase or decline of nature is driven by the amount of land needed for 
  agricultural production. Therefore it is the result of the interplay of all 
  driving forces with macro economic growth, demography and technical development 
  as most important drivers. In most scenarios technology develops faster than 
  the growth percentage of food and feed demand. Therefore less and less agricultural 
  land is needed. This leads to land that will be abandoned by agriculture. On 
  this land natural succession will start. </p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong><br>
  The expansion of natural areas in most scenarios has both negative and positive 
  impacts. In the Global Economy, Global Coordination and Regional Communities 
  scenario the amount of land that is assigned as nature increases over time. 
  This can be seen as a positive development for ecological and landscape values. 
  This development is mainly due to the abandonment of farmland in areas that 
  are less favoured for agricultural production. However, exactly in those areas 
  specific types of biodiversity related to heterogeneous, extensive landscapes 
  with low input agricultural activity used to be present. Some species will benefit 
  because of the extension of large undisturbed habitats, but other species related 
  to the semi-natural, heterogeneous landscape will be lost. </p>
<p>So besides the area the quality and spatial configuration of natural land use 
  is of the greatest importance for biodiversity. The nature, even with an increase 
  in area, may in total be of less quality, for example caused by shifts in the 
  locations of natural areas. In many cases existing nature has higher quality 
  then &quot;new&quot; nature that spontaneously emerges at abandoned agricultural 
  fields. Therefore, spatial policies and management are needed to keep nature 
  (and extensive agriculture) in the locations it is now. These policies consist 
  of, for example, encouragement of grazing to keep open nature, or strict protection 
  of areas to prevent the location from being converted. </p>
<p>Especially where agricultural enclaves in large natural areas disappear this 
  may lead to homogeneous forest land use and a potential loss of biodiversity. 
  These areas are also less diverse and therefore less attractive landscapes for 
  tourists and citizens. These developments we see especially in mountainous regions 
  and in Scandinavia where open farmland enclaves disappear. </p>
<p><strong>Used methodology</strong><br>
  Successional development of natural areas is modeled endogenously in the Dyna-CLUE 
  model, whereas agricultural development and built-up development is driven by 
  externally generated land claims. The methodology to model succession on abandoned 
  agricultural lands starts with the creation of a map for the whole of Europe 
  that indicates after what number of years abandoned areas are converted into 
  semi-natural vegetation and a similar map for the succession from semi-natural 
  to forest. These maps are based on biophysical information (mainly based on 
  climate (potential growth) and soil water available to plants (which restricts 
  potential growth)) and scenario dependent adaptations related to population 
  density (to adjust for non-agricultural uses that slow down or prohibit natural 
  succession) and grazing. Furthermore, distance to existing forest is taken into 
  account to include restrictions in seed dispersal. Dyna-CLUE keeps track of 
  the land use history and converts land use types abandoned and semi-natural 
  when they reach the age indicated in the above-mentioned maps.</p>
