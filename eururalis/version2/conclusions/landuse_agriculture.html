        Just under 50% of the EU land surface is used for agriculture. Arable 
        land and permanent crops take two thirds for its account; the other one 
        third is pasture land.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>For the EU27 in all baseline scenarios the amount of land needed 
        for agriculture will decline.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Decline of the agricultural area in the EU10 is in general smaller 
        than in the EU15. In the liberalized scenarios Global Economy and Global 
        Cooperation the EU10 reacts with an increase of agricultural area whereas 
        in the EU15 the area declines more rapidly. So both regions react differently. 
        <br>
        In the EU2 the Global Economy scenario shows an increase in agricultural 
        area. The other scenarios show a decline. The strongest decline for all 
        regions is observed in the Regional Communities scenario.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>More CAP support leads to a larger area of agricultural land-use. 
        Perhaps it is better to say to a less decline of agricultural area for 
        the Global Economy, Regional Communities and Global Coordination scenarios.<br>

<p><b>Stimulation of bio-energy crop production leads to more agricultural area. 
  In the Global Economy and the Regional Communities this effect is most visible 
  and about 0.15% per year for the EU12. The impact in the EU15 is smaller. In 
  the Global Coordination scenario the bio-energy directive does not lead to an 
  overall increase of agricultural land although the share of bio-energy crops 
  do increase. </b></p>
<p><b>Past developments<br>
  </b>Agricultural area in the EU is declining already many decades. This is mainly 
  driven by a rather stable demand for agricultural products combined with ongoing 
  improvements in yield per hectare. Less and less land is needed to maintain 
  production levels. Even under considerably protected circumstances in the EU 
  the agricultural area of the EU has diminished with 13% since the 1960s. </p>
<p>Future developments<br>
  Changes in land use are triggered by different drivers, like economic growth 
  and population growth, changes in the global agricultural economy like market 
  protection or domestic support or by developments within the agricultural sector 
  such as increasing efficiency and the introduction of new products like bio-energy 
  crops.<br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 1a - development of area of agriculture for 
  4 baseline scenarios towards 2030</span><br>
  <br>
  Figure 1a shows that the total amount of agricultural land is declining for 
  all scenarios. Although in the Continental Market (A2) scenario the agricultural 
  area for the European Union is almost stable. This is due to the combination 
  of the high population growth, the moderate economic growth with a relatively 
  low agricultural efficiency and the Transatlantic Market conditions. The other 
  three Eururalis baseline scenarios show a decrease of crop area in the European 
  region in the coming decades. The Regional Communities (B2) scenario, which 
  is the scenario with the lowest economic growth and highest market protection, 
  predicts the largest decrease in crop area for the EU10 and EU2. For the EU15 
  the Global Cooperation (B1) scenario gives a slightly larger decrease in crop 
  area. Apparently, the negative effect of relatively low economic growth in the 
  Regional Communities scenario is more dominant than the positive effect of market 
  protection for the EU12.</p>
<p>The agricultural area in the EU2 is highest in the Continental Market scenario. 
  In EU10 most agricultural land is used in the Global Economy scenario; it even 
  shows an increase in this scenario.</p>
<p>The change of agricultural land is more modest in the EU10 than in the EU15.<br>

  Figure 2a shows that arable land comprises the largest part of all agricultural 
  land. It also illustrates that the changes in arable land are in the same line 
  as the changes in total agricultural land.<br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 3a - pasture land for the 4 baseline scenarios 
  towards 2030</span><br>
  <br>
  For pasture land in the Global Economy scenario it is apparent that the trend 
  in EU2 shows a large increase while the other regions show a decrease. In total 
  there is a decrease of pasture land in all scenarios. The EU10 and the EU2 show 
  an increase of pasture land in the Global Economy scenario. Striking is the 
  difference between the opposite way the Global Economy and the Continental Market 
  scenarios play out. The new member states will see an increase of land in an 
  open Global Economy world whereas the old members than will see a stronger decrease 
  of pasture land.<br>

  Figure 3b illustrates that permanent pastures are mainly to be found in Ireland, 
  The Netherlands, Wales and England and parts of France.</p>

  <strong>Policy impact of the bio-energy directive</strong><br>
  Figure 4 shows the average changes in crop area growth for the baseline scenarios 
  with and without bio-fuels for the time period 2000 to 2030. Note that the effects 
  of introducing bio-fuels on change of crop area are small only in tenth of percents 
  on average growth over the period of 2000 to 2030.</p>
<p>The introduction of bio-fuels results in larger crops areas in the European 
  region in all scenarios except for the EU12 in the Global Co-operation Scenario 
  where the crop area remains the same. Both for EU15 and EU12 the high growth 
  and globalisation of the Global Economy is a dominant positive effect as well 
  as the market protection of the Continental Market. These are the scenario&#8217;s 
  in which the effect of the first generation of biofuels is the largest. </p>

  <b><br>
  </b><strong>Policy impact of CAP</strong><br>
  Another point of interest is the influence of CAP options on crop area changes 
  in Europe. The predicted effects are of the same order of magnitude as the effects 
  resulting from the introduction of bio-fuels, thus tenths of percents of average 
  growth.
</p>
<p>In figure 5, the average crop area growth changes for different policy variants 
  are visualized for the different scenarios. Generally the variants with more 
  market protection and domestic support result in larger crops areas than the 
  variants of the same scenario with less protection.
</p>
<p>In figure 5 you can compare the effects of protection within one scenario. Moving 
  from left to right means increasing protection, although there are two effects: market 
  market protection and income support.<br>
