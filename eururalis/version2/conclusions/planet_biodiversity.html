  <strong>Highlights<br>
  The highest biodiversity in Europe is found in Scandinavia and mountainous areas. 
  Areas with a high amount of agricultural land or urbanization show the lowest 
  values on the biodiversity index.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In future all scenarios but Continental Market show an EU27-wide increase 
  of biodiversity. The main reason is the decline of the agricultural area in 
  the EU. This former agricultural area slowly transforms into a more natural 
  environment. In some regions however biodiversity develops differently then 
  the overall EU picture and declines.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Especially the policy option on bio-energy production has a negative 
  impact on biodiversity. This policy reduces biodiversity increase with 0,5% 
  percent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also CAP payments will impact on biodiversity because with extra CAP 
  payments more area will remain in agricultural production. One the one hand 
  this prevents the transition of farmland into new nature but on the other hand 
  it leads to maintenance of extensive farming systems that contribute to specific 
  high nature value farmlands. </strong></p>

  <strong>Past developments</strong><br>
  Europe's biodiversity in past, present and future relates to a high extent to 
  the natural variety in climate, topography, soil conditions and a long time 
  regionally different pattern of land use. Typical for Europe is the large portion 
  of agro-cultural landscapes and semi-natural landscapes. Low intensity farming 
  added to biodiversity in many regions, especially in mosaic landscapes and extensive 
  pasture systems. Biodiversity is subject to serious decline over the past decades 
  or even centuries. Major causes of decline have been: </p>
<ul>
  <li>land reclamation and drainage </li>
  <li>agricultural intensification </li>
  <li>deforestation </li>
  <li>pollution </li>
  <li>urban sprawl and infrastructure </li>
  <li>land abandonment; loss of extensive traditional agriculture </li>
  <li>climate change </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Future developments</strong><br>
  In future all scenarios but the Continental Market scenario show an EU27-wide 
  increase of the biodiversity index in comparison with the year 2000 situation. 
  The main reason is the decline of the agricultural area in the EU. This area 
  slowly transforms into a more natural environment.<br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 2- Biodiversity index for 2000 and the baseline 
  scenarios in 2030</span></p>
<p>The Global Cooperation scenario shows the highest biodiversity. This is due 
  to nature friendly management of forests and in agriculture and the decrease 
  of agricultural land. Also Global Economy and Regional Communities scenarios 
  have an increase of the biodiversity index over time. In the Continental Market 
  scenario the biodiversity will decrease because of the strong pressure on the 
  land and little attention for environmentally friendly management.<br>

  <br>
  This map shows the development of the biodiversity index between 2000 and 2030 
  for the Global Economy scenario. The key message of this map is that despite 
  the overall positive EU development for biodiversity there are many regions 
  where biodiversity will decline. These regions mainly are found in Scandinavia, 
  The Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovenia, parts of the UK and the Baltic states.</p>
<p><strong>Policy effects</strong><br>
  The policy on bio-energy will influence biodiversity. Due to this policy more 
  land is used for agricultural production (to grow energy crops). Without this 
  policy this land would be abandoned on the long term and become nature. Extra 
  land for bio-fuels is in general arable land with rather low biodiversity.</p>
<p>More CAP payments also have an impact on the biodiversity through land-use. 
  When extra CAP payments are directed to farmers more land will be remaining 
  in agricultural production. This land would otherwise become abandoned and in 
  most cases become nature (forest, heath land) on the long term. On the short 
  term abandonment of extensive and traditionally farmed areas will have a negative 
  impact on biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Most important drivers</strong><br>
  The biodiversity index is mainly driven by land-use change (over 50% biodiversity 
  loss). This has a direct impact on the biodiversity; for example an old forest 
  has a higher biodiversity then intensive arable land. Other drivers are fragmentation 
  of habitats by infrastructure, urbanization or agriculture (2% biodiversity 
  loss), the disturbance by roads (2% biodiversity loss), climate change and pollution 
  by for instance nitrogen emissions (10% biodiversity loss). The chart shows 
  the contribution of different drivers for some of the scenarios. The management 
  of forests and farms (organic, new environmental standards) will also influence 
  the biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong><br>
  Developments in EU are different from developments elsewhere in the world. In 
  the EU the amount of land used for agriculture will decline the next decades 
  whereas it will increase in many other parts of the world. Therefore biodiversity 
  will probably decrease elsewhere in the world. This aspect also has to be taken 
  into account in the Global Economy and the Strong Europe scenarios. These scenarios 
  assume an 'open' world where parts of EU27s food, feed and fuel will be produced 
  outside Europe.</p>
<p>In agricultural areas biodiversity is related to the intensity of the farming 
  systems. Especially extensive livestock farming systems can contain a high biodiversity. 
  EU has a special policy targeted on these areas: the High Nature Value farmland 
  policy. Abandonment of agricultural areas in those High Nature Value farmlands 
  will lead to a loss of these special habitats.</p>
<p><strong>Used methodology</strong><br>
  This indicator is constructed to show the impact on biodiversity. The value 
  used to describe the biodiversity is the Mean Species Abundance (MSA) and the 
  approach used is derived from the GLOBIO3 concept. Biodiversity responds to 
  land use change and is affected by fragmentation, N deposition, infrastructure 
  development and land-use intensity. These factors are driven by the (global) 
  driving forces but also by specific nature policies which are spatially explicit.<br>
  The biodiversity index or MSA is derived from land-use, land use intensity (agriculture 
  and forestry), the N-deposition, fragmentation, infrastructure developments 
  and policy assumptions on high nature value (HNV) farmland protection and organic 
  agriculture. In the calculations for Eururalis 2.0 the impact of climate change 
  on biodiversity is not taken into account. Others studies show an extra negative 
  impact due to climate change of 1 or 3 percent towards 2030.</p>
