        LFA in France - the impact on agricultural abandonment<br>
        </b><b><a name="1"></a></b>The LFA policy is part of the CAP and is aimed 
        at location specific measures to support agriculture and its social and 
        environmental spin-offs. The aim of regulation is to ensure continued 
        agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable 
        rural community, to maintain the countryside and to maintain and promote 
        sustainable farming systems which in particular take account of environmental 
        protection requirements.<br>
        In Eururalis we have implemented three policy options for LFA. For a detailed 
        descriptions - see "Explore your future - About  policy - LFA". In Figure 1a and 1b
        two LFA options are shown. In figure 1a the policy without LFA and in figure 
        1b the policy options with the current LFA. In figure 2 the impact of 
        these different policy settings are illustrated.<br>

        <br>
        From figure 5 the trade-off effect of limiting the LFA policy to mountainous 
        areas is clear. In blue we see the agricultural areas that were left abandoned 
        in both scenarios. The red areas were projected to be abandoned in the 
        scenario without LFA policy only. The green areas are abandoned in the 
        scenario with LFA policy only.<br>
        <br>
        So, the LFA policy makes the red abandoned areas to shift to the green 
        areas. These are also areas that are mostly marginal for agriculture and/or 
        facing a population decline. Only supporting farmers in mountainous regions 
        will therefore lead to a shift in land abandonment to other marginal regions.<br>
        <br>
        For this example it is assumed that the total area of land abandonment 
        is similar between the two scenarios; the green area is as large as the 
        red area. In reality the feedback of the subsidies will be that the total 
        production will be higher. In general the subsidies in the LFA areas cause 
        that the situation for the farmers in the non LFA areas becomes relatively 
        less good. However since the feedback of the subsidies is not included 
        the effect of land abandonment in the non LFA areas (for the scenario 
        with LFA policy), i.e. the green areas is a little overestimated.<br>

        in this region, both in the major city regions of Marseille, Nice and

        What the results for this region clearly show, and what is also the general

        <br>
        Agricultural abandonment in these areas without specific forms of management 
        will lead to regrowth of semi-natural vegetation leading to a loss of 
        the identity and diversity of the landscape. In combination with depopulation

      <p><b>Nature in the Netherlands</b><br>
        To illustrate some of the mechanisms in spatial allocation, which are 
        dependent on the amount of change in nature area and the spatial policies 
        that influence the allocation of land use, we consider figure 1. In the two
        market oriented scenarios nature is only partly protected in the Natura 2000 
        areas (shaded in Figure 1). Conversions to agriculture are restricted, while
        conversions to built-up area are allowed.<br>
        <br>
        Even though there is a much stronger increase in built-up area in the 
        A1 scenario (and conversions to built-up are allowed in the Natura sites) 
        the Natura sites (non shaded areas in figure 1) are much more under thread 
        in the A2 scenario. (See for details table 2). In the A1 scenario the 
        increase in built area is in the decreasing agricultural areas. In the 
        A2 scenario the agricultural area is increasing. Therefore, the demand 
        for residential area comes at the expense of nature. The competition power 
        of agriculture is too high in the A2 scenario to be converted to built-up. 
        The amount and direction of land use change is very important in the land 
        use conversion that will occur (i.e. differences between scenarios in 
        competition between land use types).<br>

        B: Due to succession open landscapes may develop into forested areas. 
        Landscape diversity decreases. In some cases (for some species) this is

        location of biodiesel/bioethanol plants in the area is also given. There 
        are some important differences in the spatial pattern between these scenarios:<br>
        In the 'Global economy'-scenario, a very large plant is located at the 
        coast (i.e. at a sea-harbor) and a large hinterland caters feedstock to 
        this plant. In contrast, in the 'Regional communities'-scenario there 
        are many small plants and the biodiesel/bioethanol crops are cultivated 
        in the direct vicinity of these plants. The 'Continental markets' and 
        'Global Co-operation'-scenarios show a spatial pattern that can be considered 
        an intermediate between the 'Global economy'- and 'Regional communities'- 
        scenarios.<br>
        These outputs are consistent with the scenario assumptions; i.e. the 'Global 
        economy'-scenario assumes industrialized production of biofuels (large 
        plants located at logistical 'hubs', which import feedstock from a wide 
        area), whereas the 'Regional communities'-scenario assumes small-scale, 
        environment-friendly biodiesel/bioethanol production (smaller plants supplied 
        with local feedstock to avoid long-distance road transport and subsequent 
        CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions). The 'Continental markets' and 'Global Co-operation'-scenarios 
        have an intermediate position and assume that some plants will be located 
        at logistical 'hubs' to process feedstock from a wider area, and that 
        other plants will be located close to feedstock areas to process local 
        feedstock.

        </b>In the 'Global Co-operation' and 'Regional communities' scenarios, 
        it was assumed that policies would be adopted that would ban biodiesel/bioethanol 
        cultivation in designated NATURA2000 areas. The policy of banning biodiesel/bioethanol 
        crops from NATURA2000 areas seems to be unnecessary. Although biodiesel/bioethanol 
        crops were banned from NATURA2000 areas in the 'Global Co-operation' and 
        'Regional communities' scenarios, this ban was absent in the 'Global economy' 
        and 'Continental markets' scenarios. Nonetheless, few biodiesel/bioethanol 
        crops were allocated within the NATURA2000 areas. This is probably due 
        to the fact that these areas are often marginal lands, not easily accessible 
        (i.e. mountainous terrain), and often lack good infrastructural and industrial 
        services in the region. This makes these regions unattractive for biodiesel/bioethanol 
        cultivation<br>
        <br>
        Biodiesel /bioethanol cultivation could have a detrimental effect by stimulating further
        intensification in European agriculture. This intensification could take place in the 
        following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <LI TYPE="circle">A high demand for biodiesel/bioethanol crops could result 
          in the replacement of 'pockets' of less intensively managed land (e.g. 
          hedgerows, marginal lands, agri-environmental schemes, etc.) with biodiesel/bioethanol 
          crops. That this is not an unrealistic scenario shows the situation 
          of the Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax) in France: The Little Bustard 
          has disappeared from most European countries because of agricultural 
          intensification. Populations still exists in some Europeans countries, 
          among which France. EU-policy stipulates that farmers yearly leave a 
          part of their land out of rotation (i.e. set-aside), and the remaining 
          French populations rely almost exclusively on this set-aside land. In 
          France, farmers often use this set-aside land in agri-enviromental schemes 
          to generate income (as they are not allowed to cultivate food crops 
          on these lands). Because they are also allowed to cultivate bioenergy 
          crops on this set-aside land and these crops are more profitable than 
          agri-environmental schemes, farmers are currently switching to biodiesel 
          crops. This land use change process directly threatens the habitat of 
          the Little Bustard in France. A similar situation has arisen in Austria, 
          where set-aside land on which the Great Bustard (Otis tarda; see figure 
          2) depends, is increasingly being used for cultivating biodiesel crops. 
          These reports are even more worrying as the few remaining European populations 
          of both Little and Great Bustard are exactly located in those areas 
          that are showing most growth in biodiesel/bioethanol crops (i.e. 'hotspots') 
          according to the EUruralis biofuels-model. Large-scale cultivation of 
          biodiesel/bioethanol crops can thus have serious impacts on both species
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <LI TYPE="circle">Cultivation of biodiesel/bioethanol crops can lead to 
          landscape simplification; i.e. monocultures of biodiesel/bioethanol 
          crops could emerge that lack the diversity in crops and structure that 
          often gives European farmland it's ecological and landscape value. The 
          large bulk of biodiesel/bioethanol crops and associated transportation 
          costs to processing plants could push for a development where biodiesel/bioethanol 
          crops are located in monocultures around a processing plant. However, 
          a factor that could prevent such a development is that most biodiesel/bioethanol 
          crops are currently grown in rotational systems. Both (opposing) trends 
          were included in the EUruralis biofuels model to give insights into 
          the trade-off between these opposing trends. It is therefore interesting 
          to see that biodiesel/bioethanol crops clearly started dominating a 
          number of regions -despite including the rotational factor. Therefore, 
          the threat of landscape simplification does not seem unrealistic.<br>

        <LI TYPE="circle">As Eastern Europe has a substantial larger area HNV farmland 
          than Western Europe, the total area of biofuel crops cultivated within HNV 
          farmland is much higher in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe. The 
          cultivation of biofuel crops can have serious environmental impacts in 
          these HNV farmland areas. Moreover, agriculture in Eastern Europe is in general 
          less intensive than in Western Europe and farmland biodiversity is consequently 
          higher than in Western Europe. However, rapid development is expected 
          to occur in most Eastern European countries after accession to the EU 
          and this probably includes intensification of agriculture. A high demand 
          for biofuels could further stimulate such intensification. Indeed, the 
          biofuels-model shows an enormous increase of biodiesel /bioethanol crops 
          in Eastern Europe. Although the increase in biodiesel/bioethanol crops 
          in Eastern Europe is highest in the 'Global Co-operation'- and 'Regional 
          communities'-scenarios (which assume strong EU support for the production 
          of biofuels), the increase in biodiesel/bioethanol crops is also markedly 
          in the other scenarios. 'Hotspots' of biodiesel/bioethanol cultivation 
          in Eastern Europe include even some ecologically valuable regions such 
          as the Pannonian plain (Hungary, Sloviaka, and Austria), parts of Poland 
          and the Baltic. Given the relatively high biodiversity of most Eastern 
          European farmland and the allocation of biofuels in some ecologically 
          very valuable regions, the introduction of biodiesel/bioethanol crops 
          could have some serious impacts on farmland biodiversity in Eastern 
          Europe.
