  World trade growth increases in all scenarios, especially in the global scenarios 
  (Global Economy and Global Cooperation). The difference in world trade growth between liberalisation scenario's 
  and non liberalisation scenarios is striking. The higher growth in the liberalisation 
  scenarios is caused by the higher income growth and the impact of liberalisation 
  itself.<br>
  The reduction of border support in the Global economy contributes significantly 
  to the growth of world trade in grains, beef, processed food and especially 
  sugar. The impact of reduction of domestic support is limited.<br>
  <br>
  The difference in world trade growth between liberalisation scenario's and non 
  liberalisation scenarios is striking. The higher growth in the liberalisation 
  scenarios is caused by the higher income growth and the impact of liberalisation 
  itself (see figure 1).<br>
  <br>
  The growth in world trade is highest in sugar in the liberalization scenario 
  due to a very high level of initial protection. The growth is also high for 
  pork and poultry and oilseeds. The trend in trade that oilseeds trade is growing 
  faster than wheat and coarse grains is expected to continue. The main exporters 
  of oilseeds are Brazil and the USA and the main importers are located in Asia 
  (especially China).<br>

  The reduction of border support in the Global economy contributes significantly 
  to the growth of world trade in grains, beef, processed food and especially 
  sugar. The impact of reduction of domestic support is limited.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Explanation</em><br>
  The reduction of border support in the Global Economy scenario contributes significantly 
  to the growth of world trade in grains, beef, processed food and especially 
  sugar. The impact is limited for oilseeds, industries and services. For industries 
  this is caused by trade liberalisation in earlier WTO rounds (e.g. Uruguay round).<br>
  <br>
  The impact of reduction of domestic support is very limited and slightly negative. 
  The impact is negative because the reduction of subsidies increases prices of 
  current exporters. </p>
