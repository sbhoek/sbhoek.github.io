  Forests and pastures sequester carbon in biomass and vegetation (sinks) while 
  cropland soils emit carbon; they are carbon sources. Altogether, the terrestrial 
  biosphere nowadays sequesters 7% of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall, European's terrestrial biosphere will sequester 6-8% of greenhouse 
  gas emissions annually up to 2030.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The major part of Europe will remain a sink for carbon between 2000 
  and 2030. Largest sinks are found in the forest areas of Germany, Austria and 
  Romania. The major cropland areas (Denmark, Southeast UK, Czech, Hungary) will 
  emit carbon in all scenarios. Especially in France and Poland, carbon sequestration 
  is scenario dependent.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Land use changes can result in a decrease of carbon sequestration of 
  6 Mton C / year in the Continental Market scenario to an additional carbon sequestration 
  of maximum 16 Mton C/year in the other three scenarios.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Requirements for agricultural land and resulting land abandonment and 
  nature expansion versus expansion of agricultural lands is the main driver for 
  carbon sequestration. Therefore, although designation of less favoured areas 
  does not influence agricultural land areas, it can influence the spatial distribution 
  of carbon sources and sinks.</strong><br>

  <strong>Past developments</strong><br>
  Sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> in soil and vegetation is an important part of the carbon 
  cycle in Europe. Forests are sinks of carbon; they sequester large amounts of 
  carbon in biomass and soil, especially when they are still growing. Croplands 
  on the other hand emit carbon.</p>
<p>Up to the 19th century, large parts of Europe were deforested for agricultural 
  purposes and degraded due to among others heathland sod cutting, fuel-wood collection 
  and grazing. Between the late 19th century and the 1950's, much of the agricultural 
  and degraded land was not needed anymore and was afforested again. Therefore, 
  European forests are still young and are sequestering increasing amounts of 
  carbon (figure 2).<br>
  Nowadays, the major part of Europe sequesters carbon. The largest carbon uptake 
  is found in these still growing forests in central Europe. Cropland areas, like 
  southern Hungary, southeast UK and Denmark, emit carbon. Carbon sequestration 
  equals around 7% of the annual anthropogenic carbon emission<br>

  </b> <strong>Future developments</strong><br>
  The EU15 and EU12 differ in future carbon sequestration in land use, land use 
  change and forestry. In the Global Economy scenario, carbon sequestration will 
  decrease in EU12 and some regions will emit large amounts of carbon up to 2010. 
  This reflects arable land expansion in the EU12 up to 2010. In the EU15 on the 
  other hand, sequestration slightly decreases up to 2010 and after that will 
  increase. In the Continental Market scenario, agricultural land will expand 
  in EU15 while in the EU12 it decreases slightly. Therefore sequestration will 
  decrease dramatically in EU15. Changes in carbon sequestration in the Global 
  Cooperation scenario shows a trend comparable with the Global Economy scenario, 
  but amounts of sequestration are higher in as well the EU12 as the EU15. In 
  the Regional Communities scenario, there is also an initial decrease of sequestration, 
  but after that sequestration will increase strongly because of cropland abandonment 
  and establishment of new forests all over Europe. <br>
  Especially in France and Poland, differences in sequestration between the scenarios 
  are large. Further, the major forest areas are expected to remain sink up to 
  2030 while the major cropland areas, that are the strongest sources, are expected 
  to remain sources.<br>
  Overall, carbon sequestration in land use, land use change and forestry will 
  decrease the coming decade and will after that increase in all scenarios but 
  Continental Market (figure 3). In the Continental Market scenario, sequestration 
  will be 6% lower in 2030 compared to 2000. In the other scenarios, there is 
  an increase of around 15%. Different political choices thus can either result 
  in additional carbon sequestration or in emission.<br>

  <strong>Policy effects</strong><br>
  Designation of LFA's influences the spatial distribution of croplands. Because 
  croplands emit carbon, this also influences the spatial distribution of carbon 
  sinks.<br>
  Policies that stimulate the use of biofuels cause cropland expansion. This causes 
  an extra carbon emission, especially if deforestation is needed for the cropland 
  expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Most important drivers</strong><br>
  Carbon sequestration is driven by land use change: croplands emit carbon, while 
  forests and pasture sequester carbon. Deforestation has the largest impact: 
  forests store large amounts of carbon in biomass, and large parts of these biomass 
  carbon stocks are lost upon deforestation. Other land use changes have less 
  impact because annual losses and gains of carbon are smaller than forest biomass 
  loss.<br>
  Building up a forest biomass carbon pool takes a lot of time. Therefore, net 
  increase of forest area does not immediately increase carbon sequestration and 
  therefore location shifts of forests are very unfavorable for terrestrial carbon 
  sequestration.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong><br>
  Carbon sequestration in forestry activities that took place after 1990 can be 
  charged as a sink according to the Kyoto protocol. Eight EU15 countries and 
  Slovenia have so far decided to do so and to charge their forestry activities. 
  Together they expect to sequester 4.8 Mton C/year. This is reached in none of 
  the scenarios: all scenarios expect a decreasing forest carbon sequestration 
  up to 2010. Although these goals are not met, in all scenarios the terrestrial 
  ecosystem keeps on sequestering 5-7% (EU15) to 6-11% (EU12) of greenhouse gas 
  emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Used methodology</strong><br>
  For each land use type, a country-specific standard amount of emission from 
  or sequestration in the soil per km<sup>2</sup>  per year is specified; the emission factor. 
  When land use on a certain location changes, the emission/sequestration changes 
  immediately to the emission factor of the new land use type. In forests, the 
  emission factor is differentiated between age and in arable lands the emission 
  factor is differentiated between soil organic carbon content. Besides carbon 
  in soils, forest sequesters large amounts of carbon in vegetation. When forest 
  is removed, a major part of carbon in the forest biomass is lost from the terrestrial 
  ecosystem.</p>
