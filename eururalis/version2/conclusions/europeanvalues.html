  <b>Often mentioned values in Europe are for instance solidarity and tolerance. 
  However, the European value map does not show a homogeneous picture. Two groups 
  of countries are clearly recognizable, correlated to the wealth levels. In Western 
  and Northern Europe, there is an emphasis on secular values and self-expression. 
  In Eastern Europe, the societies emphasize survival values: hard work, economical 
  and physical security.<br>
  <br>
  The United States are often seen as the frontrunner in modernization. However, 
  the US have a more traditional value system than any other advanced industrial 
  society. The Scandinavian people and the Dutch have advanced the furthest in 
  the direction of cultural modernization and post-materialism. When it's true 
  that their trajectories will be followed by other member states, Europeans do 
  not have to look over the ocean, but to the North to see their future. (source:

  Values and scenarios<br>
  </b><br>

  <br>
  The scenarios can be associated with prevailing values and steering philosophies.<br>
  Those who rate performance and efficiency highly are more likely to prefer market 
  regulation and free trade. Those who consider equity and world peace to be the 
  highest goals are more likely to support strong -regional or international- 
  governance.<br>
  <br>
  In six countries, citizens have been questioned on their favorite scenario and 
  accompanying values. As many as 75% of the surveyed Europeans feel more associated 
  with the equity world views (i.e. the B1 and B2 scenario). In this group of 
  countries, the UK is the most liberal oriented.<br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 2 - Scenario and world view preference in six 
  countries. Between the countries there is much overlap. Adapted from Verhue 
  and Adriaansen, Waarden en wereldbeelden in Nederland en Europa, 2005.</span><br>
  <br>
  This world view preference can be associated with the results of a survey on 
  CAP preferences (Eurobarometer 276, TNS opinion & social, 2007): </p>
<ul>
  <li>Northern and Western Europe with its secular, post-material orientation 
    prefers a CAP aimed at environment, sustainable production, animal welfare 
    and product labeling. These preferences are strongly connected with the Global 
    Cooperation Scenario. 
  <li>Eastern Europe, with an orientation on survival values, chooses a CAP for 
    the protection of family-type farms and the stabilization of the agricultural 
    market. These preferences are partly connected with the Continental Markets 
    scenario. Aren't these ideas similar to the ideas of the EU-6 in the year 
    1957, when signing the Treaty of Rome? 
  <li>Possibly a third group of countries can be distinguished, who would like 
    to give attention to the liveability of the rural areas and have a preference 
    for autarky. This can for instance be seen in France. This preference leads 
    to a conservative CAP position. 
</ul>
<br>

Favorable scenarios for West and East</b><br>

<br>
Scenario's can not be chosen. However, different parts of Europe have their own 
favorite scenario:
<ul>
  <li>In Northern and Western Europe (left picture) the environment and the nature 
    are developing in a positive way in the Global Cooperation scenario. The biodiversity 
    increases and the livestock density decreases. This leads to a reduction of 
    large nitrogen surpluses, which are currently present in regional hotspots 
    in for instance The Netherlands, Belgium and Bretagne). 
  <li>In Eastern Europe (right picture) the agricultural employment and the agri 
    share in GDP will decrease in all scenarios. In the regionalized scenarios 
    (A2 and B2) this process is slowed down to a certain extent, under the influence 
    of an relative stable CAP. 
</ul>
<b><br>
Values and policies</b><br>
There is a large similarity between societal values, policy preferences and scenario results. This is for instance relevant for the upcoming discussion on the CAP reform.<br>
Viewpoints on a future CAP will differ between countries as well as within countries. Given the observed values and preferences it might however be expected that a few group of countries will take clearly different positions. These positions will not change easily, since they are firmly rooted in the national societal values.<br>
An agreement on larger policy changes might come within reach by looking to the 
longer term future. In what way can be responded to the opportunities and threats 
in the next 30 years?
