        <b>Highlights<br>
        The amount of bio-energy crops increase in all scenarios, also in scenarios where 
        no specific stimulating policy on bio-energy is foreseen. In 2000 approximately 0.3 
        percent of the EU land surface is used for first generation bio-energy crop production.
        In 2030 this increases to just over 1% for scenarios without and to almost 3% for 
        scenarios with policies that stimulate production. The spatial pattern of first 
        generation bio-energy crops differs strongly per scenario. It depends on the production 
        and processing strategies chosen. Especially the scale of processing and the dependence 
        on imports of raw products from other regions will affect bio-energy crop production 
        patterns given the high transportation costs to the processing locations.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NE-Germany, parts of Poland, Lithuania, North of France and the border area of Slovakia, 
        Hungary and Austria are main production regions of bio-energy crops in all scenarios. These 
        regions probably stand out because they have a combination of well-developed infrastructure 
        and large areas of suitable cropland.

        <strong>Past developments</strong><br>
        Renewable energies are seen as a way to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to
        contribute to a secure energy supply for Europe. Currently, around 4% of the EU's 
        total energy consumption is met from biomass (EEA report 7/2006). Development of 
        biomass production for energy develops rather slow compared to other renewable 
        energy sources like wind or solar power production. The EU intends to increase the 
        use of renewable energy. This will require a substantial rise in the use of biomass.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Future developments</strong><br>
        In Eururalis only bio-energy production with use of the so-called first generation is
        looked at. This comprises the production of bio-diesel and bio-ethanol from regular
        agricultural crops such as rape, wheat and sugarbeets.<br>

        In figure 5 the land-use by bio-energy cropland is indicated. It can clearly be seen that 
        in 2030 the amount of bio-energy crops has increased in all scenarios. There are 
        substantial differences in the share of bio-energy between the four baseline scenarios. 
        In the Global economy - and Continental markets- scenarios the share of bio-energy is 
        smaller than in the Global Co-operation and Regional communities scenarios. The latter 
        scenarios assume strong governments that rely less on market-based solutions and more on 
        government regulations. This includes strong EU support for bio-energy cultivation, which 
        can explain the larger share of bio-energy in these scenarios. Most of these 'extra' bio-
        energy are allocated in Eastern-Europe.  Despite (important) differences in allocation 
        between the scenarios, similar areas are showing most growth in biodiesel/bioethanol 
        crops in all the scenarios. Apparently, these locations are much more suitable for bio-
        energy than others. These areas probably stand out because they have a combination of 
        well-developed infrastructure and large areas of suitable arable. Examples include 
        NE-Germany, parts of Poland, Lithuania, agricultural areas around Paris, and around the 
        border area of Slovakia, Hungary and Austria.       
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Policy effects</strong><br>
        The most influential is the bio-energy policy itself. With this policy the amount of bio-
        energy in the fuel consumption will be targeted at 5.75% by 2010. This will lead to an 
        increase of cropland used for bio-energy consumption. Total land used for first generation
        bio-energy production goes up from 0.3 percent in 2000 to between 2.2 and 2.9 percent in
        2030 when the bio-energy directive is implemented. This would mean that under these 
        circumstances in 2030 4 to 6 percent of agricultural area would be used to contribute 
        to 5.75% target of the bio-energy directive.<br>

        <strong>Discussion</strong><br>
        The bio-energy directive will stimulate the production of biofuel crops. It will reduce 
        the amount of abandoned land. Though the location of biofuel production will mainly be 
        the large very fertile cropland areas; this means that prevention of abandonment in Less 
        Favoured Areas is not directly seen.  The EUruralis project limits itself to bio-energy 
        crops used for the production of either biodiesel or bioethanol. Both types of crops are 
        grouped together in the model as 'biodiesel/bioethanol crops'. So-called 'biomass' or 
        'second-generation' bio-energy crops are not (yet) considered, although these crops could 
        have a large environmental impact due to different management/cultivation patterns.<br>
      </p>   
      <p>
        <strong>Used methodology</strong><br>
        The demand of bio-energy crops is implemented in the Gtap model as a separate Gtap-E (energy) 
        module. The allocation of bio-energy crops is done with the CLUE model. The bio-energy-model 
        allocates biodiesel/bioethanol crops independently in each country in time-steps of a year for 
        the period 2000-2030. The area of biodiesel/bioethanol crops that is allocated per year in each 
        country is based on GTAP- calculations. The bio-energy-model itself consists of two different 
        modules. The first module concerns the allocation of processing plants that are needed to 
        process biodiesel/bioethanol crops, whereas the second module concerns the actual allocation of 
        crops themselves (taking into account the location of processing plants).<br>&nbsp;<br>
