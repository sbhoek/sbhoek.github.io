  The impacts  are more pronounced in the Regional Communities scenario than in the Global

  growth rate differences.</span><br>
  <br>
  For the EU12 a similar development can be observed however at a slightly lower level 
  compared to the EU15, which is mainly due to the lower production of  bio-fuel crops 
  in the initial situation in the EU15.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Large impact of bio-energy policy</strong><br>
  Without mandatory blending, the targets of the EU Biofuel Directive (BFD) will not be reached. 
  Mandatory blending has a strong impact on agriculture at global and European levels. The 
  long term trend of  declining real world prices of agricultural products eases up. The 
  incentive to increase production in the EU will tend to increase land prices and farm income
  in the EU and other regions. The EU will not be able to produce domestically the feedstocks 
  needed to produce the biofuels according to the BFD targets and therefore will incur a higher 
  agricultural trade deficit. Biofuel crop production expands in other highly industrialized 
  countries and especially in South America (Brazil).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Mandatory blending </strong><br>
  Ambitious goals have been set by the EU Biofuel Directive (BFD) for the transport sector: 
  the minimum share of biomass or other renewable transport fuels must be 5.75% in 2010. Even 
  without a enforced use of biofuel crops through a mandatory blending, the share of biofuels 
  in fuel consumption for transportation purposes increase. This endogenous increase in biofuel 
  production is due to the fact that the ratio between crude oil price and prices for biofuel 
  crops changes in favour of biofuel crops (see, Banse et  al. 2007). Under the &lsquo;Global 
  economy, w/o BFD&rsquo; scenario biofuel shares increase. The highest increase is in the 
  already integrated market of Brazil  where the initial 2001 share of more than 29% expands 
  to more than 42% in 2030. In Germany and France the endogenous growth of the biofuel share 
  leads to a biofuel consumption for transportation in 2030 at the levels of 4.0% in Germany 
  and 3.4% in France. These results reveal that without a mandatory blending the 5.75% biofuel 
  share will not be reached in the member states of the EU.

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 3 - Development of share of biofuels in fuel consumption for transportation for 
  selected regions, in %, 2001 and 2010</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Impact on food prices</strong><br>
  With an enhanced  biofuel consumption as a consequence of the EU Biofuel Directive, prices 
  of  agricultural products tend to increase. This is especially the case for those products 
  that are directly used as biofuel crops. Under the &lsquo;Global economy&rsquo; scenario, 
  without a mandatory blending the real world prices for agricultural products tend to decline, 
  conforming to their long term trend (see Figure 4). This is caused by an inelastic demand 
  for food in combination with a high level of productivity growth. Under the &lsquo;Global 
  economy with BFD&rsquo; scenario, agricultural world prices rise relative to the reference 
  scenario. However, the implementation of the EU Biofuel Directive will slightly reduce the 
  increase in crude oil prices. Given the assumption that biofuels lead to less CO2 emissions  
  than fossil fuel, the decline in the world oil price also indicates that the EU  biofuel 
  directive leads to less CO2 emission on the global level.

</p>
<p><strong>Domestic  production or imports?</strong><br>
  Large scale production of &lsquo;biofuel crops&rsquo; in Europe will be necessary to meet 
  the ambitious future targets. In the &lsquo;Global Economy&rsquo; scenario, the demand for 
  biofuel crops used in  the petrol sector will be 7.3 billion USD (in 2001 values) under the 
  minimum blending of 5.75%. Around 42% of these inputs will be produced domestically and 58% 
  of biofuel crops used in the petrol sector will come from imports (see  Figure 5). If 
  mandatory blending is not enforced, the use of biofuel crops is  much lower in all 
  scenarios: only 2.5 billion USD under the &lsquo;Global Economy&rsquo;  scenario and 
  only 1.7 billion USD under the &lsquo;Regional communities&rsquo; scenario. The lower 
  demand under &lsquo;Regional communities&rsquo; is due to a lower increase in income 
  compared to the &lsquo;Global Economy&rsquo; scenario.

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 5 - Biofuel Crops Used in the EU-27 (in Mill  USD, 2001), 2030</span>
</p>
<p>
  The degree of openness under both scenarios is also reflected in Figure 5. Under the &lsquo;Global 
  Economy&rsquo; scenario, without mandatory  blending the share in imported biofuel crops used for 
  biofuel production is  53.5%, while under the higher protection under the &lsquo;Regional 
  community&rsquo; scenario imported biofuel crops contribute only by 28.5% to total biofuel  
  production. If the Biofuel Directive is enforced, imports in biofuel crops strongly increase 
  even under the more protected &lsquo;Regional communities&rsquo; scenario.
</p>
<p><strong>EU will become a net-importer</strong><br>
  Figure 6 shows that  the EU-27 will become net-importers of agricultural commodities used for 
  the  production of biofuels under the biofuel scenarios. South and Central  America as well 
  as other high income countries expand their  net-exports in agricultural products for biofuel 
  production. <br>

  under different scenarios</span>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Worldwide expansion</strong><br>
  In all regions  mandatory blending also leads to an increase in total agricultural output, 
  see Table 1. Comparing the results of the &lsquo;Global economy&rsquo; scenario with and 
  without the BFD the strongest relative increase in agricultural output takes  place in the 
  EU and South and Central America.

<p>
  Table 1 presents the  results for changes in oilseed production which strongly expands 
  under the  policy scenarios. Oilseed production in the EU27 increases from 7.6% in the 
  &lsquo;Global economy w/o BFD&rsquo; scenario to 26% &lsquo;Global economy with BFD&rsquo;
  scenario.
</p>
<p>
  The BFD creates  similar effects under the &lsquo;Regional communities&rsquo; scenario.
  These production  developments lead to a similar pattern of land use developments. Land 
  use increases  in all regions when comparing the impact of the EU Biofuel Directive. In 
  the  EU15 the decline in agricultural land use, as a consequence of the  liberalization 
  in the &lsquo;Global economy&rsquo; scenario, is smaller under the BFD  scenarios. This 
  expansion of agricultural land use on a global scale, and  especially in Southern America, 
  might indicate  a decline in biodiversity in these countries, as land use is an important  
  driver for biodiversity.
</p>
<p><strong>Smaller income loss</strong><br>
  Apart from the direct  impact of an increase in biofuel demand on prices and production, 
  the changes  in agricultural income from agricultural are significant. The income losses  
  will be a bit smaller under the BFD scenarios. The positive development in  incomes is 
  mainly due to higher agricultural prices. Agricultural income  outside the EU increase;
  in Africa, Asia and South and Central America.
</p>
<p><strong>R&amp;D investments needed</strong><br>
  Without mandatory  blending to stimulate the use of biofuel crops in the petroleum sector, 
  the  targets of the EU Biofuel Directive will not be reached in 2010. Mandatory  blending 
  leads to higher petrol prices, as biofuel feedstocks are not  profitable to use in fuel 
  production given the current technologies. The  increased demand for biofuel feedstocks 
  raises their price relative to the price  for oil, and therefore adds to the challenge of 
  making biofuels competitive. If  biofuels have to be competitive in the long run, therefore, 
  investments in  R&amp;D are needed to obtain higher agricultural yields or better conversion  
  technologies for the feedstocks. A limitation of this study is that EUruralis 2.0 focuses 
  only on 1st generation biofuels. Decisions on R&amp;D investments should take into account 
  the 2nd generation biofuels, as these promise to be  more cost effective and more effective 
  in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The results heavily depend on the evolution of the 
  price for crude oil. The higher the crude oil price the more competitive biofuel crops 
  become for liquid  fuel production.
