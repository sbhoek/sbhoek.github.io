  <b>Highlights</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>European rural areas are far from uniform. Differences such as climate, 
    soil and historic socio economic developments have made Europe the heterogeneous 
    and diverse continent as it is today. This diversity is an important value 
    of Europe today.</b></li>
  <li><b> From an EU perspective most of the regions facing socio-economic 
    problems are concentrated in the EU12.</b></li>
  <li><b> From an EU perspective most of the regions with agri-environmental 
    problems (agricultural abandonment, erosion, livestock pressure) are concentrated 
    in the EU15. </b></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Regional typology</em><br>
  Each region has its own strengths and weaknesses or its threats and opportunities 
  for the future. Looking at the maps for the future with the Eururalis 'explore 
  your future' tool shows the regional differences already very sharp. To upscale 
  the results and to be able to draw more general conclusions, we chose a simple 
  regional typology to describe the regions characteristics to be able to go into 
  the meaning of the results for the regions. This typology is based on land-use 
  and the economic significance of agriculture. We first distinguished between 
  Peri-Urban regions, Nature regions and Agriculture regions. In the latter category 
  we made a refinement based on the contribution of agriculture to the economy 
  of the region. So we distinguished agricultural regions with high and medium 
  or low value added.<br>
  <br>
  In the next sheets each of these regions and their main characteristic are highlighted.</p>
