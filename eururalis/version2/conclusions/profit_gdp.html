  <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
  Income growth rate in EU10 countries is higher than in EU15 countries in all 
  scenarios. Despite higher income growth rates in developing and transition countries, 
  the high income differences with developed countries (EU and High Inc.) will 
  not disappear in the near future </b></p>

  <b>Future developments</b><br>
  The process of transition continues in the accession countries (EU10). Income 
  growth is high (2-3 times that of the EU15). The level of income is less than 
  50% of that of the EU15 and there is ongoing structural change in their economies 
  and especially in agriculture. Economic growth will accelerate in the EU-10 
  after accession. Structural change will be supported by structural funds and 
  rural development. The EU15 economies are more saturated. The economies grow 
  slowly and there are relatively stable structures in the whole economy.<br>
  <br>
  The <em>Global Economy </em>(A1) scenario (se scenarios >>) assumes the WTO 
  negotiations are successful, global trade fully liberalized and a further Eastwards 
  EU enlargement (including Turkey). Technological change is high. Poor countries 
  will catchup and experience high economic growth. This scenario shows the highest 
  income growth for almost all regions.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Global Cooperation</em> (B1) scenario assumes that international cooperation 
  is successful and trade will be liberalized, but under conditions for people 
  and planet (e.g. climate change). This results in lower productivity growth 
  in economic terms and a lower economic development than in A1, especially for 
  the EU where these concerns are important. We observe high growth rate in the 
  EU accession countries (EU10).<br>
  <br>
  In the Continental Market (A2) scenario the focus is on markets, though national 
  or continental interests prevails. The United States and EU create a Trans-Atlantic 
  internal market. This yields welfare gains in EU and the United States in contrast 
  with poverty in developing countries.<br>
  <br>
  In the Regional Communities (B2) scenario both economic and non-economic values 
  are important while regional or national interests prevail. Trade and agricultural 
  policies remain almost unchanged, except for export subsidies, EU integration 
  is only partial and technological change is limited. The resulting economic 
  growth is lower than in other scenarios. Social values lead to catching up of 
  developing countries because they can adopt existing technologies from developed 
  countries.<br>

  <b>Policy effects</b><br>
  The impacts of the policy options (CAP policies and biofuel policies) on GDP 
  is very limited.<br>
