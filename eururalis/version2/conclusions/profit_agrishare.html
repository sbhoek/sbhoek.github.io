  <b>Highlights</b><br>
  <b>Share of agri-food complex in economy keeps on falling in all scenarios 
  for 2030 compared to 2000. The higher the welfare level in a country the more 
  important industry and services become and the lower the share of the agri-food 
  complex. For most developing countries outside the Continental market, the A2 
  scenario implies the highest share of agriculture in 2030. Economic development 
  is slow in developing countries as the are left outside the Transatlantic market.</b></p>

  <b>Future developments</b><br>
  The historic trend continues in the sense that the shares of agri-food complex 
  in economy keeps on falling. On the one hand people spend relatively less money 
  on food as their income gets higher (low income income elasticity of demand) 
  ,on the other productivity growth is higher than in other sectors such as services. 
  The latter effect causes that agricultural prices decline relatively to the 
  general price index. People do not buy much more food if it gets cheaper (a 
  low price elasticity of demand). All in all the value share of agriculture will 
  decline.<br>
  <br>
  Faster economic growth leads to a lower share of the agri-food complex. For 
  the EU15 and the US this implies that the share is lowest in the Global Economy and Continental Markets scenarios 
  where growth is highest. For most developing countries outside the Continental 
  market, the A2 scenario implies the highest share of agriculture in 2030. Economic 
  development is slow in developing countries.</p>
