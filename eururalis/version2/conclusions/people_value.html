  <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
  Value added growth per employee in agriculture is partly dependent on the overall 
  level of economic growth. Therefore, it is highest in the Global Economy scenario and lowest 
  in the Regional Communities scenario. </b></p>
<p><b>In general the growth is higher in the developing and the EU12 countries 
  than in the high income countries. The exception is in the Continental markets 
  scenario where the EU and US build a transatlantic market. Here, the income 
  per employee is much higher within this market than outside this market. </b>
