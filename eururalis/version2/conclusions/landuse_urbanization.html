        The built-up area grows in all scenarios. The extent of growth differs 
        per scenario and depends largely on demography, economic growth and welfare 
        and spatial planning policies.<br>
        <br>
        New built-up land is mainly evolving from urban sprawl. This is because 
        immigrants from outside the EU tend to live in or close to larger cities, 
        while the emigration from larger cities to rural areas lags behind.<br>
        <br>
        In the Global Economy scenario urban areas grow about 25% until 2030. 
        This means that in 2030 in Global Economy almost 5% of the land surface 
        will be used for urban activities. The other three scenarios show a much 
        more limited growth (under 10%).<br>
        <br>
        Different spatial planning policies result in different urbanization patterns 
        in the current situation. This will also affect the future impacts of 
        urbanization. Without stringent spatial planning aimed at compact urbanization 
        some areas of Europe will become peri-urban landscapes.</b></p></td>

<p><b>Past developments</b><br>
  Urban area in Europe has been showing a steady growth of 4 to 5% each decade: 
  a trend that set in with the rebuilding of Europe after the Second World War. 
  The drivers of this expansion are threefold: Intensification of agriculture 
  and the low economical growth of the agricultural sector lead to migration from 
  rural areas to the cities; immigrants from outside Europe also moved to the 
  cities; and with increasing economical growth the area per person grew with 
  rates around 1 to 2 m2 per person per year. The urban growth generally occurred 
  in the fringes of existing agglomerations although a few examples of completely 
  new cities exist (e.g Lelystad, the Netherlands, Louvain la Neuve, Belgium).<br>

    <td valign="top">Figure 2 shows the development of built-up area. This shows 
      that built-up land is growing fastest in the Global Economy scenario. Important 
      drivers are the population growth due to immigration in this scenario and 
      the increasing demand of area per person due to economic growth. The combination 
      with a spatial policy which is not aimed at compact urbanization leads to 
      the largest expansion of urban areas as well as a sprawled pattern.<br> 
      <br>
      The other three scenarios show a more limited growth of built-up area. In 
      the Continental Market and Regional Communities scenarios population growth 
      in Europe is limited as well as the need for extra built-up land. In the 
      Global Coordination scenario, despite the rather strong population growth 
      the increase of built-up land is limited because of more strict spatial 
      policies, which is in line with the spirit of this scenario. </td>

  <b>Policy effects</b><br>
  The policy options of Eururalis do not influence the amount of land needed for 
  urbanization, but they do affect the spatial pattern. Spatial planning processes 
  focus much stronger on urban land-use than, for instance, on agriculture or 
  natural land use types. Besides the differences in amount of land use change 
  in urban area the patterns of urbanization differ significantly between the 
  scenarios because different spatial policies are assumed (Table 1)<br>

<p><b>Most important drivers</b><br>
  Like in the past, new urbanization is driven by population growth (immigration 
  rates for that matter), by rural-urban migration dynamics and by increasing 
  surface-demands per person. High immigration rates lead to the growth of larger 
  cities that are generally denser, whereas a migration from urban to rural areas 
  would lead to more space consumption per person as built-up area is less dense 
  in rural areas. Differences in the spatial patterns of urbanization are the 
  result of different preferences for residential areas, competition with other 
  land use types (such as nature protection) or spatial policies.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Discussion</b><br>
  The results indicate that, depending on the demography and economic growth, 
  land claims for residential or industrial purposes can be large in Europe. Due 
  to the historic location of urban areas and the preference for flat lands the 
  most fertile, productive, agricultural soils are taken out of agriculture for 
  urban purposes, causing an irreversible loss of production capacity. At the 
  same time the open landscape is disturbed by urban construction. For the peri-urban 
  areas it is likely that the functionality of the land use faces changes towards 
  recreational, tourism and leisure purposes.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Used methodology</b><br>
  Urbanization is simulated within the spatially explicit land use modeling component 
  based on the Dyna-CLUE model. </p>
