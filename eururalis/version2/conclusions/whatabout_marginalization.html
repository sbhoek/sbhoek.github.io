  <li><strong>Land abandonment in Europe is one of the most important land use 
    conversions: </strong></li>
  <li><strong>It comprises a large area with high landscape impacts </strong></li>
  <li><strong>It has a major impact on various indicators like biodiversity, erosion 
    and economic viability. </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Land abandonment occurs in all scenarios. In three out of four scenarios 
    land abandonment takes place on a large scale; between 9 and 13% of the agricultural 
    area of 2000 will change into another land-use before 2030. </strong></li>
  <li><strong>The Continental Markets scenario shows a divergent development. 
    In this scenario only a small amount (less than 2%) of agricultural land is 
    changed to abandoned land</strong></li>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 1- Meta hotspots map for agricultural abandonment 
  for the 4 baseline scenarios</span></p>
<p>Although the amount of agricultural abandonment is coarsely comparable in the 
  scenarios Global Economy, Regional Communities and Global Cooperation, the spatial 
  patterns shows significant differences. This is due to different spatial policies 
  for these scenarios and different comparative advantages of agricultural production. 
  In the Global Economy scenario agriculture is preferentially concentrated in 
  the highly productive areas while the Regional Communities scenario favours 
  regional production and protection of cultural-historic landscapes. </p>
<p><strong>Hotspots of abandonment</strong><br>
  Figure 1 depicts the four baseline scenarios that project agricultural abandonment 
  in a certain location. Blue areas are only facing abandonment in one or two 
  of the scenarios while red areas show abandonment in three or all four scenarios.</p>
<p>The regional differences show that some regions are almost certain to face 
  large scale abandonment (red in the map), regardless of the scenario or chosen 
  policy options. The same holds for regions that will never face agricultural 
  abandonment (dark grey in the map). Whatever policy measures taken, they will 
  hardly have an impact on the continuation of farming in these regions. </p>
<p>Some regions only face land abandonment in some of the scenarios &#8211; these 
  regions could be abandoned by agricultural activities but could stay in agriculture 
  as well depending on policies and development of demography, global trade etc. 
  In these regions policy may influence the future of farming. Nonetheless the 
  total area of agriculture needed is more or less fixed. So preventing abandonment 
  in one region most likely leads to abandonment elsewhere. </p>
<p>Since the four baseline scenarios represent a broad scope of possible future 
  developments the meta-hotspot map can be read as an indication of the likelihood 
  that a location will show land abandonment. This map can for example be used 
  to focus detailed studies and policies on land abandonment towards areas with 
  high likelihood of agricultural abandonment. </p>
<p>In the red areas policies are likely to not have any effect on prevention of 
  land-abandonment on the longer term. Circumstances for production are unfavourable 
  to maintain agriculture there. In these areas the message to policy makers could 
  be not to invest money in maintaining agriculture but to look for other rural 
  development options. In the blue areas policy might be able to make a change. 
  The blue areas appear to be the areas where policy measures should be targeted 
  at. </p>

</table>
<p>The difference in agricultural area between 2000 and in 2030 is not equal to 
  the area of abandoned land for two reasons. The abandoned areas are all areas 
  that were under agriculture in 2000 and that are &quot;left behind&quot;. Conversions 
  from agriculture to built area are not counted as abandonment. Another reason 
  is that agriculture may have shifted to other areas. This increases the area 
  abandoned land, but does not necessarily decreases the area of abandoned land 
  since it may be patches of natural vegetation that are converted for new agricultural 
  land. Especially in Eastern Europe such changes in the location of agricultural 
  areas are found. In a number of scenarios the agricultural area tends to increase 
  in the period 2000-2010 due to the benefits of joining the European Union and 
  CAP support. This leads to the conversion of patches of natural vegetation in 
  the most productive areas. After 2010 these countries also face abandonment 
  of farmland. Abandoned farmlands are mostly the most marginal locations. </p>
<p><strong>Spatial patterns</strong><br>
  The aggregated results in Table 1 do not give any information about the distribution 
  between countries and the spatial pattern within countries. These distributions 
  and patterns can be quite different between the A1, B1 and B2 scenarios, especially 
  because they include different sets of spatial policies. </p>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 2- Land use abandonment in 2030 as percentage 
  of agricultural land in 2000 for the reference scenarios.</span></p>
<p>The maps in Figure 2 indicate that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Abandonment is situated mostly in mountainous regions due to marginal suitability 
    for agriculture. </li>
  <li>The northwestern part of the Iberian Peninsula is a region with high abandonment. 
  </li>
  <li>Abandonment in Sweden and Finland countries is large in relative terms because 
    a large part of the agricultural sector is affected. However, in terms of 
    area this is small, because agricultural area is only a small proportion of 
    the land in this region. </li>
  <li>In the A1 and B1 scenarios the abandonment is most concentrated in the EU15 
    and in the B2 scenario abandonment in more in the EU12. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Main driving forces </strong><br>
  The main driving forces of land abandonment include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Trade (increase imports) </li>
  <li>yield increases </li>
  <li>decreasing subsidies </li>
  <li>relocation of agricultural production from marginal areas to more productive 
    areas in order to maintain competitive farming. Most often such relocation 
    is the result of increases in the scale and area under agriculture in the 
    most productive regions and the discontinuation of farms in marginal regions. 
    This phenomenon is especially apparent in the global economy scenario where 
    agriculture is focused on the regions with the best production characteristics.<br>
    Some of the areas under thread of abandonment are culturally or ecologically 
    valuable areas. For such areas the impacts of land abandonment can be large 
    and irreversible. In these culturally and environmentally important areas 
    the need for policy measures and the search for alternative management options 
    is needed the most. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Policy impacts</strong><br>
  LFA Policy will only shift the pattern of land abandonment. The total amount 
  of agricultural area is constant between the three LFA policy options in the 
  current Eururalis framework. With LFA policy implemented more agriculture remains 
  in place in mountainous areas. Spatial policies that focus on supporting farmers 
  like LFA, can reduce loss of agriculture in marginal areas but only partially. 
  Some areas are simply too adverse to produce in an economically viable way, 
  even with subsidies. </p>
<p>Bio-energy policy leads to an extra demand for crop land. This will reduce 
  the amount of agricultural abandoned land. For instance for the Global Economy 
  scenario we see that due to the biofuels policy extra land will stay in production. 
  Without a bioenergy policy the amount of agricultural land would have decreased 
  by 12%. With the bioenergy policy the decrease of agricultural land is limited 
  to 4%. The policy on bio-energy has therefore significant impacts on agricultural 
  land-use. Again spatial patters differ throughout Europe.<br>
  CAP support in general leads to less agricultural abandonment.</p>
