  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Governments have a variety of reasons for intervention. 
      In general they either want to prevent undesirable and stimulate desirable 
      developments. Policies are executed in many ways, on many issues and on 
      different scale levels. In Eururalis only policies that more or less directly 
      impact on rural areas and its land-use are taken into consideration. Also 
      these policies are limited to those that have an EU wide basis. The focus 
      is therefore on policies such as: the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), 
      the international agreements on nature protection, policy (Natura 2000, 
      Birds and Habitat Directive) on protection of the environment and health 
      (Nitrates Directive, Water Framework Directive) and the EU policy to stimulate 
      the implementation of Bio-energy.</b></td>

<p>For many policies series of assumptions have been made within the storylines 
  of the four scenarios. Nevertheless, within a scenario sometimes more future 
  options for the same policy theme are possible. Eururalis provides four so called 
  policy buttons. Within the storyline policy packages can be chosen interactively. 
  By doing so the scenario is adjusted in a desirable way and the differences 
  on impact on several indicators can be explored. In a way a large number of 
  sub-scenarios are created.<br>
  <br>
  In Eururalis there will be four policy buttons available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CAP market support policy</li>
  <li> CAP income support policy</li>
  <li> Bio-energy policy</li>
  <li> Less Favoured Area policy<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p> For each policy button three or four packages with discernable strategic policy 
  measures are developed. The policy packages are the result of discussions with 
  the Eururalis Policy Advisory Group. In future possible other policy buttons 
  might be added, like for instance extension of the Rural Development Policy 
  or policies on water, environment and nature.<br>
  <br>
  A detailed explanation of the four policy buttons is given in separate sheets 
  under '<em>about policy</em>'.</p>
