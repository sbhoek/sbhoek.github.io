<p>Agricultural and trade policies are important factors that shape the future 
        of agriculture and rural areas. These policies are characterized by a 
        complex interplay between export subsidies, import tariffs, production 
        quotas, tariff rates and may include decoupled or coupled income transfers. 
        The current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will be in place until 2013. 
        After 2013 the CAP is likely to change fundamentally and cause major effects 
        e.g. on agriculture, land-use and livestock patterns. In Eururalis the 
        policy option for the CAP is divided into two separate options.<br>
        <br>
        The first option concerns<em> CAP Market Support</em>. There are three 
        settings for this option: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Full liberalization; in 2010 there will still be market support but 
          this will be abolished by 2020 and reduced to zero. 
        <li>Decreased market support, which means that in 2010 there will still 
          be market support but by 2020 the market support will bereduced by 50% 
        <li>Continuation of market support which means that the current level 
          of market support is continued. 
      </ol>
      The second policy option for CAP is the CAP Income Support. This option 
      is described in a separate sheet.</td>
