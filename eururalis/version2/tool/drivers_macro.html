  Income is an important driver which can be expressed as Gross Domestic Production 
  (GDP). Growth of income affects the future of rural areas directly and indirectly 
  in a variety of ways. Some examples will be presented. Especially in the poorer 
  countries the demand for food and the nature of the demand (shift to more expensive 
  products such as fruit and livestock products) will influence agricultural production 
  in the region and the import of products and commodities. When GDP is higher 
  a faster pace of technological development is assumed. Also it is assumed that 
  a higher GDP leads to an increasing demand for space needed for housing, infrastructure 
  and recreation and hence urbanisation.</b><br>
  <br>
  GDP is assumed to grow in all scenarios for all continents. GDP growth per capita 
  is a measure of income increase. Between the scenarios there are significant 
  differences in the rate of growth. In general the <i>Global Economy</i> scenario 
  shows the highest growth rates. Asia shows the highest growth rates of the groups 
  of countries.<br>
  The income growth rate in EU10 countries is higher than in EU15 countries in 
  all scenarios, especially in the <i>Global Cooperation</i> scenario.<br>

  <br>
  The process of transition is likely to continue in the accession countries (EU12). 
  Income growth is high (2-3 times that of the EU15). The level of income is 
  less than 50% of that of the EU15 and there is ongoing structural change in 
  their economies and especially in agriculture. Economic growth accelerated in 
  the EU12 after accession. Structural change will be supported by structural 
  funds and rural development. The EU15 economies are more stable and will grow 
  slowly.<br>

  Despite higher income growth rates in developing and transition countries, the 
  large income difference with developed countries (EU and High Income) will not 
  disappear in the near future.</p>

  <b>Global overview</b><br>

  <br>
  <span class="tekstklein">In the <i>Global Economy</i> scenario growth is highest 
  in developing countries (Central Africa and South- East Asia) and lowest in 
  High Income countries (USA, EU, Japan, and Australia-New Zealand). In Central 
  and Eastern Europe growth is higher than in EU15.</span><br>

  <span class="tekstklein"><br>
  In the <i>Global Cooperation</i> scenario income growth is relatively low for 
  the High income countries (EU15, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia- New Zealand). 
  For Africa growth is even higher than in the Global Economy scenario.</span><br>
