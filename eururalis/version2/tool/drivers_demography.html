  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><p>The extent of the human population is an important driving 
        force. Future growth or decline and changes in the nature of a regions 
        population influence rural areas in different ways. The number of people 
        firstly determines the demand for food and therefore agricultural production 
        and trade. Secondly the amount of labour available and the amount of space 
        needed for urban land-use like housing, recreation and infrastructure 
        are dependent on demographic features. Furthermore population size and 
        nature strongly interact with another driver: the economic growth (income).</p>
      <p>Depending on the scenario, in the period 2000-2030 Europe's (EU27) population 
        will grow slightly, as in <i>Global Economy</i> and in <i>Global Cooperation</i>,or 
        decrease as in <i>Continental Markets</i> and <i>Regional Communities</i>. 
        In all scenarios the average age of the population will rise sharply.<br>

Concerning demography large large regional differences are expected. In Southern 
and Eastern Europe the population will probably decrease. In all scenarios the 
rural population will decrease and the urban population will continue grow. <br>
<p><img src="images/drivers_demography_graph.gif" width="716" height="518"></p>
<p>Population size and structure are determined by three fundamental demographic 
  processes namely fertility, mortality and migration. For each of these three 
  variables scenario specific assumptions have been made (Table 1). For the EU 
  it is assumed that the fertility rate is more or less linked with economic growth. 
  Life expectancy in Western European countries is considered to be high and slowly 
  rising in all scenarios. The speed of convergence in other EU-countries to this 
  level of life expectancy also depends on the economic growth rate in these countries. 
  The same applies to the migration rate.</p>

Figures 1 to 3 show that in <i>Global Economy</i> and <i>Global Cooperation</i> 
the population will increase and in the other scenarios the population will decrease. 
The increase in the <i>Global Economy</i> and <i>Global Cooperation</i> scenario 
is to a large extent caused by migration in these open world scenarios. In the 
<i>Global Economy</i> scenario the population of the EU27 will grow by approximately 
5% from 481 to 505 million people in 2030. Also in the <i>Global Cooperation</i> 
scenario there will be an increase in population, but by 3% to 494 million people. 
In the <i>Continental Market</i> scenario the total population of EU27 will decrease 
slightly, most sharply in the 12 new member states. In the <i>Regional Communities</i>-scenario 
the population will decrease by almost 7% to 448 million inhabitants.<br> 
<br>
In all scenarios the "grey pressure" (ratio of number of people older then 65 
years and population between 15-64 years) will sharply increase. For the EU15 
this will be an increase from 25% in 2000 to 38% in 2030 in the <i>Global Economy</i> 
scenario. In the <i>Regional Communities</i>-scenario people over 65 will increase 
to 45% of the population from 15-64 years in 2030.<br>   
<br>
<br>
The rural population is most likely to decrease in all scenarios. This is partly 
caused by a decreasing total population but mainly by increasing urbanization. 
The share of rural inhabitants in the total population is however harder to predict 
than the total population. Moreover, the definition of "rural population" strongly 
differs from country to country. More insight as to the extent, causes and effects 
of the shrinking population is therefore needed.<br>

Figure 5 shows that compared to developing countries European population growth 
will stagnate in all scenarios. Worldwide growth of the population is an important 
driver for the global demand for food and effects agricultural production and 
international trade.
