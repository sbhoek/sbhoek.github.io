    <td valign="top"> <p><b>The future of Europe is not only determined by Europe 
        itself, but depends partly on developments on the global level. Growing 
        populations and income in other countries, such as China, India and Brazil, 
        the future of international trade barriers and trade opportunities, the 
        Euro/US dollar rate and the oil price, are examples of factors that are 
        outside the EU but that influence our daily life ánd our future.</b><br>
        <br>
        Driving forces influence the European rural area and its functions for 
        society. Some are relatively exogenous, such as the macro economic growth 
        or global change processes. Other factors can be influenced, but depend 
        on complex political decision making, such as the extension of the EU, 
        or immigration policy. The outcomes of such discussions are highly uncertain. 
        Various forces act synchronously and interact. Their impact will vary 
        through time and from region to region. Their future role is hard to assess. 
        Some processes are hard to predict, whereas others can be quantified within 
        reasonable limits.</p>
      <p>The scenario approach tries to specify consistent story lines that distinguish 
        between the nature, rate and extent of various driving forces. The following 
        drivers are distinguished: </p></td>

<p><b>EU-enlargement and trade arrangements (WTO)</b><br>
  The effects of the EU enlargement in 2004 will become more clearly over time, 
  both in the old EU15 as in the new member states. In some scenarios further 
  expansion is possible. International agreements (eg WTO) have not made much 
  progress lately, but this might change over the coming years. Geopolitical relations 
  will determine trade barriers and influence the patterns of international trade. 
</p>
<p><b>Macro-economic growth</b><br>
  The world economy is a powerful determinant of changes in agriculture and other 
  sectors (eg industry and services). Higher incomes lead to a changing food demand. 
  In general when poor people can spend more money. Diets may also change towards 
  more expensive products such as fruits and vegetables and especially meat and 
  dairy. Changes in food demands, both in the EU and outside the EU, are likely 
  to influence EU agriculture.</p>
<p><b>Demography</b><br>
  Demographic change is an important driver. The growth or decline of populations 
  and major migration flows influence the demand for food directly, but also indirectly 
  the availability of farm workers. In case of declining population growth of 
  the number of ageing of people is important especially in remote rural areas. 
  Also in rural areas the flow of people into the towns is relevant.</p>
<p><b>Technology</b><br>
  Technology is a major driver. It has caused major and fast shifts in agriculture 
  via higher efficiency in production (per farm, per hectare, per hour). In future 
  these shifts will continue, both inside and outside Europe. This trend interacts 
  with the development of other economic sectors which can then use the capital, 
  labour, space that is freed by the process of agricultural evolution. Examples 
  of other advances that will influence rural Europe are information technology, 
  logistics and infrastructure. New inventions are hard to predict, but once their 
  relevance has been shown, rapid dissemination of technologies can nowbe assumed.</p>
<p><b>Climate change</b><br>
  Climate change and sea level rise are affecting natural systems, which in turn 
  may have major impacts on society. Climate change up to 2030 is likely to not 
  to be influenced. But the effects of different abatement policies may become 
  more clearly visible after 2030.Climate change not only leads to a rise in average 
  temperature, but also is likely to cause more extreme events, such as heavy 
  rainfall, or long periods of drought.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Consumer behaviour</b><br>
  Consumer patterns encompass al kinds of human preferences and behaviour. These 
  preferences and behaviour generally change slowly but their impact is significant. 
  Diet preferences, the attitude towards animal welfare, views on nature conservation 
  and environmental protection and the acceptance of government intervention are 
  examples of human behaviour that inpact on the future of rural areas.<br>
  <br>
  <b>EU and national policies</b><br>
  The European Commission and national governments try to steer the future in 
  the right direction - or prevent it going in the wrong direction! - and develop 
  policy measures. Policy is made at various scales. In Eururalis strategic policy 
  measures that are generally implemented at the EU-level are looked at. These 
  include environmental policies and rural development policies etc.<br>
  <br>
  Each of these drivers is clarified more extensively in its own sheet. For each 
  of the four basic scenarios a link to an extended list of assumptions is available.
