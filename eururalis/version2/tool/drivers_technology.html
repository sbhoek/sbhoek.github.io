Technology and yields</b><br>
In modern society technology is an important driver. Developments are continuous 
and appear to procede at increasing rate. <br> 
<br>
In rural areas specifically the technological progress in agriculture has led 
to increased productivity, decline of farm workers and decline of biodiversity. 
During the last century parallel with major changes in technology the output and 
productivity of agriculture have shown a large increase. For example wheat yields 
grew at an average of 3.8% a year in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s but has now slowed 
down to 2% in the 1990s. For rice the rates went from 2.3% to 1.1 % over the same 
period.<br>
In the western world, though at a slower pace, yield growth is expected to continue 
in future. New technologies such as genetic modification, GPS, robots and information 
systems together with better management and education of farmers will contribute 
to maintain this trend.<br>

    <td valign="top"><b>Raising labour productivity and agricultural employment</b><br>
      Generally speaking, in countries with lower incomes (see information on 
      macro-economic growth), the labour productivity in agriculture is lower 
      then in high income countries, mainly due to lower mechinisation. This means 
      that there is room for increasing labour productivity in these countries. 
      This generally requires an input of capital, technology and management skills. 
      Raising the labour productivity has however two pitfalls. It usually leads 
      to a reduction of the number of people working in agriculture, partly hired 
      farm workers or farmers themselves. Secondly, it can lead to land abandonment 
      in certain regions, since not all land is suitably for mechanised farming.</td>

<b><br>
Crop yields</b><br>
Productivity in main crops can improve significantly due to technical advances 
and modern management. Mediterranean and accession countries can therefore raise 
their production per hectare by tens of percents. The same potential holds for 
developing countries.<br> 
<br>
In the past a major increase in productivity in crops has taken place. Likewise 
the present situation can be assessed in terms of higher potential yields, when 
accounting for improvements in management and technology. The difference between 
actual and feasible yields can be indicated as yield gaps. The higher the yield 
gaps are, the larger the opportunities to raise production levels.<br>
Eururalis compared data for the period 1996 -2000 for the main crops (shown in 
table 1) taking into account water limitation as determined by weather conditions 
in various EU countries. Calculations were carried out for the current climatic 
conditions.<br>  
<br>
One important indicator is the gap between simulated potential yield, being the 
maximum that can be obtained for a specific crop cultivar under given weather 
conditions and the actual yields. Table 1 shows the yield gap for a number of 
countries.<br> 
<br>

and countries based on 1996-2000 simulations:<br>

The above data are conservative. Historical data show a continuous improvement 
of production levels due to e.g. new cultivars and new technologies or management. 
In future the use of Genetically Modified Crops GMC's could add to higher yields, 
that surpass current theoretical potential yields.<br>
<br>
The yield gaps presented were extracted from CGMS system that contains European-wide statistical yields data (NUTS-1 level) and simulated potential and water-limited yields using model WOFOST. Values presented represent five year averages (1996-2000). Data were then spatially aggregated to country level.<br>
<br>
Outside the scope of agriculture new technologies are likely to lead to change. 
For example the impact of developments such as information and communication technology, 
infrastructure and logistics and new energy technologies are likely to be important 
but heir magnitude is difficult to predict. For example more people can now work 
from their homes. This may limit eventually the need for new urban development 
and the flow of rural inhabitants towards the towns.
