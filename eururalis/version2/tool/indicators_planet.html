<b>Livestock density </b>(livestock units per ha of agricultural land)<br>
The livestock sector is the world's largest user of land. Livestock is strongly 
related to grassland and feed-crop production and its spatial concentration may 
lead to environmental problems. Livestock Density (LD) reflects the spatial distribution 
of different livestock types.<br> 
Land use, altitude, slope, carrying capacities of the land, soil suitability, environmental parameters such as climate, and the demand for animal products strongly influence the spatial distribution of livestock. The change of livestock numbers is simulated by considering the initial livestock distribution, the carrying capacities of the location, land use and assumed policies, and technological developments that may affect spatial distribution.<br>
<br>
<b>Nitrogen surplus</b> (kg nitrogen per ha of agricultural land)<br>
Different nitrogen compounds can be harmful for the environment (ammonia, nitrate, nitrous oxide). The nitrogen surplus (difference between the input and output of nitrogen) is an indicator of the risk of nitrogen losses.<br>
The nitrogen surplus depends on changes in the number and type of animals, the use of fertilizer, and changes in crop yields and areas affect the nitrogen surplus.  Biological nitrogen fixation and atmospheric nitrogen deposition also play a role but are of less importance.<br>
<br>
<b>Biodiversity index</b> (0-100 index)<br>
This indicator is constructed to show the impact on biodiversity. The value used to describe the biodiversity is the Mean Species Abundance (MSA) and the approach used is derived from the GLOBIO3 concept. Biodiversity responds to land use change and is affected by fragmentation, N deposition, infrastructure development and land-use intensity. These factors are driven by the (global) driving forces but also by specific nature policies which are spatially explicit.<br>
The biodiversity index or MSA is derived from land-use, land use intensity (agriculture and forestry), the N-deposition, fragmentation, infrastructure developments and policy assumptions on high nature value (HNV) farmland protection and organic agriculture.<br> 
<br>
<b>Erosion risk (area with risk) </b><br>
Soil erosion (sheet and rill) is a major factor in land degradation and loss of soil quality. Furthermore, eroded sediment ends up in rivers and water bodies, where it disturbs fragile water ecosystems. Soil erosion strongly responds to land use, particularly to spatial patterns of land use.<br>
A potential for soil erosion is derived from topography, rainfall regime and soil erodibility (according to the USLE principle), whereby rainfall regime is considered to be variable in time. The land use maps resulting from each scenario are used to derive a measure for the protective vegetation cover, so that an actual soil erosion map can be obtained by multiplying the potential soil erosion map with vegetation cover maps. (USLE principle).<br>
<br>
<b>Carbon sequestration</b> (Ton C/km<sup>2</sup> )<br>
Large amounts of CO<font size="-2">2</font> can be sequestered in the terrestrial 
ecosystem. This can contribute to climate change mitigation. This indicator represents 
the amount of carbon that is sequestered in or emitted from land use, land use 
change and forestry.<br> 
Different land use types differ in the amount of carbon they sequester or emit in soil and vegetation. Carbon is sequestered in soils of forests, pasture, natural vegetation and emitted by croplands and parts of wetlands. Additionally, in forests large amounts of carbon are stored in vegetation as well. Changes in land use can thus result in changes in carbon emission / sequestration.<br>
<br>
<b>Landscape character</b> (km<sup>2</sup>  of landscape changed)<br>
This indicator is constructed to determine landscape change without any evaluation in term of good and bad change. Normative indicators are constructed separately for, for example, ecological and economic parameters.<br>
Determination: dominant land use type in a reclassified land use map with three big classes, combined with structure by using the Shannon diversity index.<br>
The most simple land use in land use indicator would be to see which location 
show change between two years. However, landscape also implicates the surroundings 
of an area. Therefore neighborhood statistics to summarize some of the key landscape 
parameters were used.
