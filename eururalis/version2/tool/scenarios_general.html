    <td valign="top"><p><b>Because the future is uncertain, EUruralis 2.0 
        is built on four scenarios. These scenarios represent uncertainties in 
        as to how the world might develop and in policy choices. </b></p>
      <p>Key driving forces within scenarios are political developments on both 
        European and global scales, macro-economic growth and demographic developments. 
        Other important drivers are technology (The Internet was not foreseen 
        30 years ago), climate change (to be influenced in the long run, but not 
        for the coming 15-20 years) and consumer behaviour. EU and national policies 
        are also important. </p></td>

  </tr>
</table>
<p>The four scenarios also relate to different plausible developments defined 
  by two axes. The vertical axis symbolizes a global approach as opposed to a 
  more regional approach to problems and strategies. The horizontal axis represents 
  an open market compared with a higher level of intervention and regulation by 
  governments.<br>
