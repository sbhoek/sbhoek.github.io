  <b>Governments have a variety of reasons for policy intervention. In general 
  they either want to prevent undesirable and stimulate desirable developments. 
  Policies are executed in many ways, on many issues and on different scale levels. 
  In Eururalis only policies that more or less directly impact on the economies 
  and land-use of rural areas are taken into consideration. We limited these policies 
  to those that have an EU wide basis. This means the focus is on policies like: 
  the Common Agricultural Policy, the international agreements on nature protection, 
  policy (Natura 2000, Birds and Habitat Directive) on protection of the environment 
  and health (Nitrates Directive, Water Framework Directive) and the EU policy 
  to stimulate the implementation of Bio-energy.</b><br>
  <br>
  For many policies series of assumptions have been made within the storylines 
  of the four scenarios. Nevertheless, within a scenario sometimes more future 
  options for the same policy theme are possible. Eururalis provides four so called 
  policy buttons. Within the storyline policy packages can be chosen interactively. 
  By doing so the scenario is adjusted in a desirable way and the differences 
  on impact on several indicators can be explored. In a way a large number of 
  sub-scenarios are created.<br>
  <br>
  In Eururalis there will be four policy buttons available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CAP market support</li>
  <li>CAP income support</li>
  <li>Bio-energy policy</li>
  <li>Less Favoured Area policy</li>
</ul>
For each policy button three or four packages with discernable strategic policy 
measures are developed. The policy packages are the result of discussions with 
the Eururalis Policy Advisory Group. In future possible other policy buttons might 
be added. Like for instance extension of the Rural Development Policy or policies 
on water, environment and nature.
