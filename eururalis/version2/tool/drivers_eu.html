<b>The EU27 itself is enlarged by Turkey, the Balkan countries and the Ukraine. 
In the <i>Continental Market</i> scenario the EU forms a trade block together 
with the USA and Canada. In the <i>Regional Communities</i> scenario the EU will 
form a block of its own. In the latter two scenarios the EU remains EU27 and trade 
within the EU is promoted.</b><br>
<p><b>Impact on trade</b><br>
  The highest growth in trade, especially with Asia and Africa, occurs in the 
  two global scenarios (<i>Global Economy</i> and <i>Global Cooperation</i>). 
  Nevertheless also in the regional scenarios (<i>Regional Communities</i> and 
  <i>Continental Market</i>) international trade figures increase.<br>

  <b>Assumptions per scenario</b><br>
  The <i>Global Economy</i> scenario assumes that the WTO negotiations are successful, 
  global trade will be fully liberalized and a further Eastwards EU enlargement 
  (including Turkey) will take place. Technological change is high. Poor countries 
  will catch up and experience high economic growth. This scenario shows the highest 
  income growth for almost all regions.<br>
  <br>
  The <i>Global Cooperation</i> scenario assumes that international cooperation 
  will be successful and that trade will be liberalized, but with limitations 
  under certain conditions for people and planet (e.g. climate change). This process 
  will result in lower growth in economic terms and a lower economic development 
  than in Global Economy, especially for the EU where these concerns are important. 
  There will be a high growth rate in the EU accession countries (EU10+2).<br>
  <br>
  In the <i>Continental Market</i> scenario the focus is on markets, though national 
  or continental interests prevails. The USA, Canada and the EU create a Trans-Atlantic 
  internal market. Such a unity will yield welfare gains in these regions, in 
  contrast with poverty in developing countries.<br>
  <br>
  In the <i>Regional Communities</i> scenario both economic and non-economic values 
  will be important whilst regional or national interests prevail. Trade and agricultural 
  policies will remain almost unchanged, except for export subsidies. EU integration 
  will only be partial and technological change will be limited. The resulting 
  economic growth is lower than in other scenarios. Social values will lead to 
  catching up of developing countries because they can adopt existing technologies 
  from developed countries.</p>
