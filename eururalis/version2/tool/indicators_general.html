<br>
Background <br>
The impact of the scenarios and policy options is assessed for the various domains of sustainability: people, planet and profit. The resulting set of indicators is extended with indicators on land-use.<br> 
<br>
The indicators are presented at different scale levels: some are at square kilometer 
grids, but are at the regional level (over 600 EU regions) and all at the EU25+2 
countries level. The results have been aggregated for the EU15 and the EU10+2 
and as well for peri-urban regions, nature regions and three types of agricultural 
regions order to make comparisons on macro level. <br>
<br>
The selection of the indicators depended on: 
<ul>
  <li>The balance between the four domains of people, planet, profit and land-use. 
  <li>Issues of political interest. 
  <li>The availability of data and causal relationships had to be available at 
    country level but preferably at the regional scale. 
  <li>The need to avoid excess of information. Sub-indicators were sometimes 'upscaled' 
    to one general indicator. 
</ul>
The calculations of the indicators are based on the same consistent input data 
and assumptions and result from the models used in the Eururalis framework. Each 
of the planet indicators has a separate meta-model that uses input of the core 
models (GTAP, IMAGE, CLUE).<br> 
<br>
The methodology of calculating the indicators is described in the detailed fact-sheet 
per indicator which you can find in the 'Background' part of Eururalis 2.0.
