  <b>The Continental Markets scenario depicts a world of divided regional blocks. 
  The EU, USA and other OECD countries form one block. Each block is striving 
  for self suffiency, in order to be less reliant on other blocks. Trade barriers 
  continue to exist.</b><br>
  <br>
  The <i>Continental Markets</i> scenario assumes:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top"> <ul>
        <li>That social and cultural values can best be preserved in regional 
          political alliances with like-minded countries, within which nation 
          states should keep as much sovereignty as possible. </li>
        <li>Protection measures remain in place. Within this constraint, the society 
          prefers market-based solutions.. </li>
        <li>After accession of Romania and Bulgaria no further enlargement of 
          the EU. </li>
        <li>The EU will form a single market with the USA and Canada. </li>
        <li>The policy regarding the international mobility of people from third 
          countries is restrictive. Cohesion policy is not seen as a priority. 
        </li>
        <li>The overall economic growth rate is lower then in Global Economy and 
          Global Cooperation, especially in the Central and Eastern European countries 
          as well as in developing countries. </li>

<ul>
  <li>The technological development is also lower than in the other two scenarios. 
  </li>
  <li>Maintenance (and extension) of nature reserves are not a priority. </li>
