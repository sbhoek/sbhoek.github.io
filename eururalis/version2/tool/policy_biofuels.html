        The EU has a high ambition regarding the use of biomass as source of energy. 
        In Eururalis 2.0 two policy options have been implemented: </b></p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>No targets for the use of biomass in 2010 or later </b> 
        <li><b>A target of 5.75% biofuels for transport, 75 million tons 
          of oil equivalent of biomass for heating and 174 TWh of electricity 
          produced with biomass, upto 2010 and the following years. </b>
      </ol>
      <p>The EU perceives an increase in the use of biofuels as one of the ways 
        to reduce the emission of CO<span class="tekstklein"><font size="-2">2</font></span>, 
        and therefore as a way to fulfil the obligation of the Kyoto protocol.

The EU has also other reasons to stimulate the share of biomass in its energy 
  supply as follows:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Diversification of Europe's energy supply</li>
  <li> Enhance employment (250 000 - 300 000) (biofuels employ 50-100 times as 
    much people as fossil fuel)</li>
  <li> Exerting a downward pressure on oil prices<br>
    <br>
    Roughly, three types of biomass use can be distinguished, as follows (Annex 
    to the Communication from the Commission, BAP-scenario):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Biofuels for transport; in 2002 being 1 mtoe, with a goal of 19 mtoe by 
    2010 (5.75% of total use); 
  <li>Biomass for heating, in 2002 being 48 mtoe, with an indicative goal of 75 
    mtoe by 2010; 
  <li>Biomass for electricity generation, in 2002 being 48 TWh, with an indicative 
    goal of 174 TWh (being roughly equivalent to 56 mtoe) by 2010; 
</ol>
In the EU-impact assessment it is assumed that only 70% of transport biofuels will be produced in the EU-25, 85% of the biomass for electricity generation and 90% of the biomass for heating purpose.<br><br>
Given current EU and member states policies it is not likely that the targets 
for 2010 will be met. Therefore, extra policies probably will have to be considered, 
which may differ from country to country. In order to have a uniform approach, 
it is assumed for Eururalis that these targets are fixed obligations, so a shortage 
in biofuel will lead to a higher price, and therefore more production.<br>
<br>
The question is to which costs biofuels will be are produced and with which effects (on example employment, land use, biodiversity, compliance with WTO).<br> 
<br>
In the use of biofuels for transport, new technologies are likely to be important 
(such as the second generation of biofuels, derived from cellulose, but also other 
developments like new crops, eg castor beans). In the use of biomass for heating 
the development of efficient and clean boilers is important. Also the use of biomass 
in combined heat-and power installation (CHP) is an efficient way to benefit from 
biomass. In the present version of Eururalis, it has not been assumed that the 
use of second generation of biofuels will become available. Partly because it 
is uncertain when these new biofuels technologies will become available, partly 
because of present limitations in modelling these biofuels. Therefore, the biofuel 
target is not raised after 2010, since it is not likely that higher shares of 
biofuels are feasible without the second generation of biofuels technology.
