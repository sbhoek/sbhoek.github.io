  <b>The Global Economy scenario depicts a world with fewer borders and regulation 
  compared with today. Trade barriers are removed and there is an open flow of 
  capital, people and goods, leading to a rapid economic growth, of which many 
  (but not all) individuals and countries benefit.</b><br>

  The <i>Global Economy</i> scenario assumes: </p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
<ul>
        <li>Multilateral cooperation on economic issues, including successful 
          WTO negotiations leading to elimination of almost all trade barriers. 
        <li>CAP subsidies and cohesion policy are phased out by 2030. 
        <li>Societies are predominantly driven by market-based solutions, resulting 
          in high economic growth rates, particularly for poorer countries. 
        <li>A strong technological development. 
        <li>The role of the government is limited to core responsibilities, such 
          as basic education, security, major infrastructure ensuring conditions 
          for competitive markets, law enforcement. 
        <li>Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria as well as some Balkan countries, Ukraine 
          and some smaller countries have joined the EU. There is a flexible policy 
          regarding migration. 
        <li>Maintenance (and extension) of nature is not seen as a priority for 
          the government and is mainly depending on private initiatives. </ul></td>
