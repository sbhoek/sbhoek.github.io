<b>The Global Cooperation scenario depicts a world of successful international 
cooperation, aimed at reducing poverty and reducing environmental problems. Many 
aspects will be regulated by the government, e.g. carbon dioxide emissions, food 
safety and biodiversity. Trade barriers will be removed.</b><br>
<br>
The <i>Global Cooperation</i> scenario assumes:<br><br>

    <td valign="top"> <ul>
        <li>Multilateral cooperation on many issues, aiming at a fair distribution 
          of wealth, social justice and environmental stewardship. </li>
        <li>Trade barriers will be gradually removed. </li>
        <li>Developing regions (inside and outside the EU) will be supported to 
          eliminate poverty. </li>
        <li>The level of CAP subsidies is reduced, with domestic support specifically 
          targeted at environmental sustainability and to catalyse rural development, 
          aiming to stimulate the European model of agriculture. </li>
        <li>The economic growth rate in the EU and other OECD countries is strong, 
          but less then in Global Economy. The economic growth in other regions 
          is slightly higher then in Global Economy.</li>
        <li>A strong technological development, partly focussed on environmentally 
          friendly production method.</li>

  <li>Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria have joined the EU. There is a flexible policy 
    regarding international mobility of people from outside the EU. No limitation
