<b>GDP - Gross Domestic Production (Index)</b><br>
Gross Domestic Production per region as a percentage of Gross Domestic Production 
in 2001. This indicator shows how fast GDP in a region grows. Be aware that total 
GDP is not the same as the sum of all levels of production, because GDP is value 
added, and so excludes intermediate inputs, while production includes it. Percentage 
change in GDP is calculated on a national level and downscaled is accomplished 
by applying those percentages, corrected for the region being lagged or advanced, 
to the regional GDP levels.
<p><b>Agri share in GDP - Share of primary agriculture in GDP (%)</b><br>
  Value of primary agricultural value added as a percentage of Gross Domestic 
  Product. This indicator shows the change in importance of primary agricultural 
  production. This change has several reasons. One is policy changes, e.g. EU-accession 
  in the New Member States; another is the difference in technological progress 
  in agriculture compared to non-agricultural sectors. A third one reflects the 
  fact that demand for agri-food products increase less than other commodities, 
  e.g. services. </p>
<p><b>Real farm income (Index)</b><br>
  Total real regional farm income as a percentage of real regional farm income 
  in 2001. It is deflated by a national GDP deflator. </p>
<p><b>Farmers&#8217; welfare - Value added per worker in agriculture relative 
  to the whole economy (Index)</b><br>
  Value added per worker in agriculture as a percentage of the value added per 
  worker in 2001 divided by GDP per worker (calculated at national level) as a 
  percentage of GDP per worker in 2001. It indicates the growth in welfare of 
  farmers relative to that of other people. Be aware that the indicator includes 
  not only income from labor, but also from capital and land. This indicator is 
  calculated on a national level, and it is the same for all regions within a 
  country.</p>
<p><b>Crop production (Index)</b><br>
  Primary production of crops in prices of 2001 as a percentage of the value of 
  primary crop production in 2001.</p>
<p><b>Animal production (Index)</b><br>
  Primary animal production in prices of 2001 as a percentage of the value of 
  primary animal production in 2001.</p>
