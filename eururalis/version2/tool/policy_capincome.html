  Common Agricultural Policy - Income Support</b></p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
<p>Agricultural and trade policies are important factors that shape the future 
        of agriculture and rural areas. These policies are characterized by a 
        complex interplay between export subsidies, import tariffs, production 
        quotas, tariff rates and may include decoupled or coupled income transfers. 
        The current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will be in place until 2013. 
        After 2013 the CAP might change fundamentally causing major effects on 
        agriculture, land-use and livestock patterns.<br>
        <br>
        In Eururalis the policy option for the CAP is split into two separate 
        options. The first option concerns the <em>CAP Market Support</em> and 
        is described in the previous sheet.<br>
        <br>
        The second policy option for CAP is the <em>CAP Income Support</em>. There 
        are four settings for this option: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Abolishment of all income support, which will take place after 2010 
        <li>Decreasing income support, which means that the budget for income 
          support will be reduced by 50% until 2030 
        <li>Stable income support which means no change in the budget for income 
          support until 2030 
        <li>Increasing income support which means that the budget for income support 
          will be increased by 50% until 2030 </ol>
