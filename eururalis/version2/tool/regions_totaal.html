  About maps & regions</b><br>
  <br>
  The maps of Eururalis are presented at four spatial scale levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>grid level (square kilometers);</li>
  <li> regional level (668 regions);</li>
  <li> country level (27 countries)</li>
  <li> level of cluster regions (5 cluster regions).</li>
</ul>

<p> <b>Regional division</b><br>
  In Eurualis Europe is divided into 668 regions. The division of regions is based 
  on the HARM regional division for the EU25. This division is taken because this 
  is the lowest scale level where detailed information is available. For Bulgaria 
  and Romania this division is not yet available. For those regions the NUTSX 
  division was taken.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Cluster regions</b><br>
  The information on the 668 regions is not only aggregated to 27 EU countries, 
  but also to the 5 cluster regions. The cluster regions are divided in the following 
  five types</p>
<ol>
  <li>peri urban regions</li>
  <li> nature regions</li>
  <li> agri high </li>
  <li> agri medium </li>
  <li> agri low </li>
</ol>
<p> The peri urban regions are those regions that are predominantly peri-urban 
  according to the OECD typology (1994). The second type of regions consist of 
  regions where the share of agriculture in the total land-use is less than 25%. 
  These regions have a predominantly natural land-use. </p>
<p>The remaining regions all have a high share of agricultural land-use, but differ 
  in the economic significance of agriculture.<br>
  The agri high regions are regions where agriculture contributes to more than 
  15% of the regions total gross value added (GVA). In the agri low regions the 
  GVA from agriculture is less than 5%. The medium regions are in between.</p>
