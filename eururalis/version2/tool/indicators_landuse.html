<b>Agricultural area (% of total area)</b><br>
Spatial distribution of agricultural area including: arable land (incl. irrigated area), permanent pasture and permanent crops<br> 
This indicator shows the share of agricultural land in the region. The results are derived from the Land-use map and consist of all agriculture land use categories.<br>  
<br>
<b>(Non-irrigated) arable agriculture area (% of total area)</b><br>
The spatial distribution of non-irrigated arable agriculture is a direct output of the Dyna-CLUE land use allocation model.<br> 
This land cover contains all agricultural land except pasture, permanent crops, biofuel crops and irrigated arable crops.<br>  
<br>
<b>Permanent pasture land (% of total area)</b><br>
The spatial distribution of permanent pasture. This land cover contains all types of pasture, including pastures for the production of fodder. In principle it exludes grassland in rotation (<5 years)<br>
<br>
<b>Biofuels crops (% of total area)</b><br>
The spatial distribution of biofuel crop cultivation. All crops that are grown with the aim to produce biofuels are included in this land cover.<br> 
<br>
<b>Natural and semi-natural land (% of total area)</b><br>
The spatial distribution of forest, semi-natural vegetation, wetlands, glaciers and snow, dunes; excluding recently abandoned farmlands. This land cover includes rangeland, heather and moorland and natural grasslands.<br> 
<br>
<b>Built up area (% of total area)</b><br>
Spatial distribution of built-up area. This land cover contains all built-up area. 
It includes continuous and discontinuous urban fabric, industrial areas, commercial 
areas, road and rail networks, airports, mineral extraction sites, dump sites, 
construction sites, green urban areas, sports facilities and leisure facilities.<br> 
<br>
<b>Urbanization hotspot map (difference with 2000)</b><br>
This indicator shows the spatial pattern of new urbanization since the year 2000.<br><br>
<b>Agricultural abandonment hotspot map (difference with 2000)</b><br>
This indicator shows the spatial pattern of former agricultural land that is taken out of production since the year 2000. The two main processes behind the agricultural abandonment are urbanization and agricultural marginalization. The new land use cover has changed from agricultural land to either built-up, recently abandoned pasture land or arable land or to the land cover of natural or a semi-natural vegetation.<br> 
<br>
<b>Land-use map</b><br>
The land-use map indicates the pattern of the main land use types with a spatial resolution of 1 km<sup>2</sup> . There are 17 classes of land-use available. The different land-use classes are described in the scheme below.<br>
