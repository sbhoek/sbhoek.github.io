<b>The Regional Communities scenario depicts a world of regions. People have 
a strong focus on their local and regional community and prefer locally produced 
food. Ecological stewardship is very important. Economic growth is the lowest 
of all scenarios.</b><br>

  The <i>Regional Communities</i> scenario assumes:<br><br>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top"> <ul>
        <li>That social and cultural values can best be preserved at the local 
          or regional community level; </li>
        <li>Self-reliance, ecological stewardship and equity are the keys to sustainability; 
        </li>
        <li>No further development of supranational institutions. National governments 
          remain responsible for foreign and security policy, fiscal policy, Justice 
          etc. </li>
        <li>CAP subsidies: increase of some 10%, linked to environmental and social 
          targets. Export subsidies are eliminated; </li>
        <li>Import barriers remain in place, to protect local markets against 
          cheap imports; </li>
        <li>Imported goods have to comply with the high EU standards regarding 
          health, environment, and animal welfare; </li>
        <li>After accession of Romania and Bulgaria no further enlargement of 
          the EU.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The overall economic growth rate is the lowest of the four scenario's; </li>
  <li>Through EU regulation (e.g. the Framework Water Directive) strict environmental 
    regulation is imposed in the whole EU; </li>
  <li>The use of renewable energy sources is strongly supported by means of subsidies 
    and R&D investments; </li>
  <li>The maintenance (and extension) of nature reserves and cultural heritage 
    are a clear priority; </li>
