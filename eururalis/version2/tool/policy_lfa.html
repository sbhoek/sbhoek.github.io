<p><b>Background</b><br>
  The legal basis of the Less Favoured Area (LFA) policy is laid down by Council 
  Regulation (EC) No. 1257/1999. The aim of regulation is to ensure continued 
  agricultural land use and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a viable 
  rural community, to maintain the countryside and to maintain and promote sustainable 
  farming systems which in particular take account of environmental protection 
  requirements.<br>
  <br>
  The current LFAs have been divided into three categories: mountain areas, lowland 
  areas (intermediate areas) and areas with the specific natural handicaps. Farmers 
  in LFAs are eligible for payments per hectare in addition to conventional CAP 
  support.<br>
  <br>
  Due to European diversity the delineation of LFAs is based on various criteria 
  appropriate for each Member State. The criteria are different in each country 
  due to climate, land relief, soil productivity and the growing condition for 
  crops. The present LFA policy will be valid until the year 2009.<br>
  <br>
  Nevertheless, to unify the criteria for LFAs, the European Commission has proposed 
  to revise the designation criteria for the most controversial one - the intermediate 
  LFAs - for the next programming period. This is subject to discussion at present 
  time.<br>
  <br>
  The restructuring of this policy will influence rural income and land abandonment. 
  Therefore it is necessary to assess the impact of changes in LFA policy on land-use, 
  biodiversity and environment of farmland. <br>
  <br>
  Eururalis 2.0 offers the possibility to evaluate three policy packages for the 
  LFAs. This can support the process of decision making of the future shape of 
  LFA Policy. Dependent on the scenario one can alter the LFA policy and explore 
  the outcomes on the indicators.<br>
  <br>
  <b>The three policy options on LFA </b><br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Current LFA - The first LFA option shows the results of maintaining the current LFAs. This is based on the LFA map provided by the Commission. Approximately 56% of the EU communities are (partially) under LFAs. The input of this is the map of current LFAs (JRC, 04/2006 LFA EU-25 (04/2006)).<br> 
  <li>Reduced LFA - The second option illustrates new LFA regions based on modified 
    criteria. In fact only the mountainous area and the areas with specific handicaps 
    are maintained in this 'in between' option. The intermediate LFA's that currently 
    exist are no longer part of this option. Approximately a quarter of EU communities 
    are under LFAs in this option.<br>
  <li>No LFA - The third option shows Europe without LFA's. No EU communities 
    are under LFA's and the map of Europe is blank. <br>
</ol>
<b>Methodological impact</b><br>
The effect of the LFA policy option is elaborated in such a way that it only influences the spatial allocation of land-use. The effect is only elaborated in the CLUE model. This results in shifting spatial patterns of allocation of agricultural land-use. Its effects on the regional economy are not (yet) taken into account.<br> 
<br>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
An alternative LFA option based on the so called Land Quality Index (LQI) was 
considered but not implemented in Eururalis. The LQI reflects the environmental 
potential for agriculture productivity as controlled by natural conditions and 
depends on soil quality, climate, and land relief and soil moisture index. Due 
to this LQI the emphasis of LFAs will be in mountainous areas and in southern 
Europe, but the difference with the 'current LFA' option was too small for a substantial 
change in land use and substantial effect on indicators. Therefore a more radical 
'reduced LFA' option was chosen.
