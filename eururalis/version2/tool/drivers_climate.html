        Due to inertia in the climate system, climate change is almost equal in 
        all scenarios the coming three decades. The rate of temperature change 
        differs more in the four scenarios. Regional Communities shows the lowest 
        impact, mainly due to low economic growth globally and, therefore, small 
        increase in energy demand. Climate policies in Global Cooperation do not 
        result in immediate impacts due to inertia in greenhouse gases like CO<sub>2</sub> 
        (lifetime is a couple of decades). Only after 2030 the scenarios do diverge 
        significantly due to differences in demography, economy and policy measures.

      <p><b>On the contrary, due to reductions in SO2 emissions that coincide 
        with climate mitigation policies, the immediate impact is an increase 
        of the global-mean temperature. </b><br>

SO2 has a cooling effect and works immediately. Therefore, the reduction of cooling 
aerosols dominates the reduction of warming gases like CO<sub>2</sub> and N2O in Global Cooperation.</b> 
<p><b>The impact of climate change on agriculture is small the coming decades, 
  although Southern parts of Europe will experience more problems due to summer 
  droughts compared with Northern parts where the positive effect of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization 
  and the extension of growing season dominates.</b></p>
<p><b><br>
  Future developments</b><br>
  Climate change is clearly an important driver of future agriculture. The Intergovernmental 
  Panel on Climate Change concluded in its latest assessment that it is very likely 
  that humans have caused most of the warming observed over the twentieth century 
  (IPCC 2007). The report also indicates that future climate change is to be expected, 
  as a function of continuing and increasing emissions of fossil fuel combustion 
  products, changes in land use (deforestation, change in agricultural practices), 
  and other factors (for example, variations in solar radiation). An important 
  question is what this would mean for agriculture in Europe.</p>
<p>IPCC calculations show in its scenarios (Nakicenovic et al., 2000) that the 
  globally averaged surface air temperature is expected to increase from 1990 
  to 2100 from 1.4 to 6.4 Celsius (IPCC, 2007) (see also Figure 1). This increase 
  would be without precedent during the last thousand years. The total range given 
  above is partly a consequence of differences in emissions, but also partly an 
  impact of uncertainty in the so-called climate sensitivity, i.e. the relationship 
  between greenhouse gas concentration and the increase in global mean temperate 
  (after equilibrium is reached).</p>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 1: Global mean temperature change under the 
  different IPCC scenarios based on the uncertainty in emissions and the climate 
  sensitivity (IPCC, 2001).</span></p>
<p>In Eururalis, the medium climate sensitivity is used, leading to a medium global 
  warming until 2030 in the range of the IPCC scenarios (Figure 2; 1.1 &#8211; 
  1.3&deg;C increase compared with pre-industrial levels; until 2000 we are already 
  committed to a warming of 0.6&deg;C).<br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 2: Global-mean surface temperature change for 
  the 4 Eururalis baselines.</span></p>
<p>High rates of temperature change are most likely to occur in the first half 
  of the century as result of the fact that even if climate policies are adopted, 
  their action will also result in lower sulfur emissions. The latter are currently 
  having a cooling direct effect on the atmosphere. Therefore, climate mitigation 
  policies will have a warming effect in the near term (less cooling SO2 emissions), 
  before the warming greenhouse gases like CO<sub>2</sub> are reduced (see Figure 3).<br>

  <span class="tekstklein">Figure 3: Rate of temperature change for the 4 Eururalis 
  baselines.</span></p>
<p>The impacts of climate change on agriculture are different per region. In fact, 
  two combined effects have to be accounted for: the impacts of climate change 
  and those of a rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. The latter (also referred 
  to as carbon fertilization) can increase yields and make plants more stress-resistant 
  against warmer temperatures and drought. Climate change can lead to both increases 
  and decreases in yields, depending on the location of changes of temperature 
  and precipitation (climate patterns) and the crop type.</p>
<p>Two regions that are likely to experience large negative impacts of climate 
  change on agricultural production are Asia and Africa (IPCC, 2007). Ironically, 
  the impacts of climate change seem to be small for Europe, although Mediterranean 
  areas are more vulnerable to climate change (due to droughts) than Northern 
  European areas. For the temperate regions climate change is in the beginning 
  (first 1-2 degrees Celsius) mostly a positive factor. Only when climate change 
  will continue to occur, negative impacts on the agricultural sector will dominate. 
  The coming decades climate change does not seem the most important challenge 
  for European farmers, although regional negative impacts cannot be excluded. 
  Current models cannot provide answers on the regional level within Europe.</p>
<p><b>Policy effects</b><br>
  Obviously, assuming climate policy may lead to lower degrees of warming. Current 
  insights indicate that the temperature increase associated with climate policy 
  scenarios currently would decrease the lower bound of the range for the IPCC 
  scenarios (Figure 1) to about 0.5-1.0 degree Celsius above 1990 level (i.e. 
  based on an insensitive climate system and using a strong climate policy scenario). 
  This implies that although these values may be uncertain, climate change is 
  expected to be very likely. In the Eururalis scenarios we assumed successful 
  climate mitigation policies in Global Cooperation and to a lesser extent in 
  Regional Communities, leading to lower energy emissions, compared with Global 
  Economy and Continental Markets where no climate mitigation policies are assumed. 
  Due to inertia in the climate system, the differences between scenarios in 2030 
  are still very small and the most important driver remains economic growth. 
  Therefore, Regional Communities has the lowest impact until 2030.</p>
<p><b>Most important drivers</b><br>
  Economic growth and, related, total energy consumption.</p>
<p><b>Used methodology</b><br>
  The global mean temperature change is simulated by the IMAGE-model (Eickhout 
  et al., 2002) on the basis of changes in the energy sector and the agricultural 
  sector. The latter part is provided by LEITAP.</p>
<p>To assess regional impacts, the global-mean temperature change needs to be 
  downscaled to a gridded level. While the computation of global mean temperature 
  is uncertain, the patterns of local temperature change are even more uncertain 
  (Figure 4). In its comparison of temperature calculations from different climate 
  models, IPCC (2007) noted some areas of agreement (such as temperature increase 
  likely being higher at higher latitudes than near the equator) but also many 
  areas of disagreement. Disagreements, for example, typically occur in areas 
  with complex weather patterns (e.g. the tropics). In Eururalis, the climate 
  pattern of the Hadley Centre is used, indicating a warming in Europe and an 
  increasing drought in Mediterranean areas.<br>
