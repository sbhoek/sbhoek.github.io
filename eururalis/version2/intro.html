            <p>The Eururalis tool enables you to explore the future of Europe.
              You can compose your preferred policy scenario by choosing one of
              the contrasting reference scenarios and adapt this base scenario
              by adjusting the settings for the strategic policy options. The
              results of your policy scenario will be provided to you in maps
              and graphs about People, Planet and Profit issues and on Land-use
              for the next decades in 10 year time steps. An integrated overview
              is presented in a so-called spider diagram. By interacting with
              the policy options and the scenarios you will get an idea of the
              possible futures of Europe and of impact of the policy options on
              reaching your desired future Europe. </p>
