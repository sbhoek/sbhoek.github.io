<p class="kop">EURURALIS concepts</p>
<p><br>

  <strong>Policy discussion orientation:</strong><br>
  Topics have been selected on current and foreseen policy relevance based upon analysis of recent EU-policy documents. EURURALIS is a discussion support, not a decision support. Facts and figures and transparency in what-if questions and answers are fundamental. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>   <strong>Specification in space and time</strong><br>
  EURURALIS offers geographical detail through a nested approach, from global level, via EU-level, to
    national level, NUTS regions (when feasible and relevant) and at a high spatial resolution of 1 km2.
    Temporal specification is
    given for each 10 year interval. between 2000 and 2030 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  <strong>Scenario-approach</strong><br>
  EURURALIS uses explorative, contrasting scenarios (four in number). We abstained from predictive scenarios.
    EURURALIS uses scientifically and politically accepted approaches (IPCC, SRES, CPB), adapted and
    detailed to service our goals. <br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Basics of sustainable development- People, Planet, Profit</strong><br>
  sustainable development where economics, ecology and socio-cultural aspects should develop in balance and mutual interest is guiding in selecting topics and valuating outcomes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From
    Drivers to changing conditions, effects and response</strong>. <br>
  Drivers are &quot;external or outside forces&quot; exerting influence on Europe's rural area and causing
  changes in People, Planet, Profit indicators. Major drivers  are shown in the
  figure. Driving processes are interrelated: climate change depends on economic growth; economic
  growth relates to demograhy or technology, etcetera.<br>
</p>


<p>&nbsp;  </p>
  <p>- World economy/welfare: demand and supply, exchange of goods and services. 
    These determine the flow of labour, income, consumption patterns, capital 
    investment and many other factors. <br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>- Climate change and related conditions: shifts in precipitation, temperature 
    and water discharge (flooding) or sea level rise bring various risks or opportunities. 
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>- Technology: has significant effects on land use and other aspects (mobility, 
    communication). As such it is hard to include in models; dissemination 
    of new technology can be assumed more easily. <br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>- (Geo-)political change implies change in international politics and policy 
    making. The increasing role of international governance, international treaties 
    (such as WTO, Agreements on Biodiversity or Environment, Kyoto). On continental 
    level the formation and expansion of the EU. <br>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>- Consumer patterns are sometimes hard to define, but are influential: e.g. consumption patterns (diet changes), an increased awareness of ecological or social problems or concerns on animal welfare. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br>
    <strong>Core models</strong><br>
    Models help to assess effects assuming changes in driving forces. Models are 
    fed with data, follow formal rules to simulate interactions and give output 
    in desired format (e.g. tables, graphs, maps). Three &quot;state of the art&quot; 
    core models are at the heart and were linked for specific EURURALIS goals. 
    Other models are used to specify effects on certain indicators.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-GTAP / LEITAP <br>
  The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model was adapted for EURURALIS(LEITAP). It simulates world
    trade for all economic sectors (agriculture including processing industry, services). &nbsp;<a href="../../pdf/leitap.pdf" target="_blank"> read
    more about GTAP/LEITAP <span class="orange">>></span></a><br>
  <br>
  -IMAGE <br>
  The IMAGE model (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment)  assesses effects of global change
  on the environment.  Spatial resolution
  is mostly on national level. &nbsp;<a href="../../pdf/image.pdf" target="_blank">read more about IMAGE <span class="orange">>></span></a></p>
<p><br>
  -CLUE<br>
  The CLUE model (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects; CLUE-s version 2.3) is used to allocate
  the predicted changes in land use at a 1 km2 resolution. &nbsp;<a href="../../pdf/clue.pdf" target="_blank">read more about CLUE<span class="orange">>></span></a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I<strong>ndicators 3 P</strong><br>
  Indicators are selected variables for the various domains of People, Planet and Profit.  In addition
    to single value indicators, we presented some meta-indicators. These are aggregated or generalized,
    to a higher level, based upon underlying EURURALIS data. <br>
