<p class="kop" style="width:400px; ">What are the aims of EURURALIS ? </p>
<p style="width:400px; "> We present data and insights to fuel discussions on threats and opportunities
  and policy options. It's a discussion support rather than a decision support system. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="kop"  style="width:400px; ">What is the angle of view?</p>
<p style="width:400px; ">We approach future developments taking scenario-methods as entrance trying to
  depict possible effects for the three domains of sustainable development: ecology. economy, socio-cultural
  aspects (People, Planet, Profit). Effects are expressed in maps, graphs, pictures; various aspects
  can be combined and judged upon their contribution to sustainability. EURURALIS starts from global
  drivers, focuses on the EU25 and presents more detailed examples for representative regions.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="kop" style="width:400px; ">For whom is EURURALIS ?</p>
<p> Three target groups can find their way :
<ul>
  <li>policy makers</li>
  <li>committed groups or individuals</li>
  <li>colleagues in research</li>
</ul>
