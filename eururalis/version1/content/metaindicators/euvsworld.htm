  <p class="kop"> Europe 's responsibilities towards the 3rd world are reason to judge scenarios upon their effects for these countries, for Europe and for their relationships</p>
  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="kop">
Global scenarios (A1 and B1 ) promote welfare increase in the Third world, but also more pressure on natural resources and biodiversity. Population pressure in the 3rd World is highest in A2 and B2 scenarios, possibly resulting in migration pressure on Europe. In view of high pressure on natural resources elsewhere Europe's production potential should be safeguarded.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Economic growth highest in A1 and B1-scenario</strong><br>
The (assumed) economic growth (per capita) in the South is the highest in the A1 and B1 global scenario's and the lowest in the A2 and B2 (regional) scenario's 
The assumption is that trade liberalization (A1 and B1) combined with more technology push (higher labour productivity) and foreign direct investments will lead to this higher economic growth. In the B1 scenario this is combined with development aid. 
</p>
  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
<strong>Still large differences in GDP per capita in 2030</strong><br>
Despite the high economic growth in the A1 and B1-scenarios the projected GDP per capita in the South is in 2030 still significantly lower then in the (present) OECD countries. For Asia, the GDP per capita changes from the present value of 7% of the GDP per capita in the OECD-countries to 6% (A2) to 11% (A1 and B1-scenario) of the GDP in the OECD countries. At present, the average GDP per capita in Africa is only 2,4% of that in the OECD countries. This will even be lower in the A2 and B2 scenario (around 2%). In the A1 and B1 scenario it will raise to 2,5 % (A1) to 3,1 (B1).
</p>
  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Stronger population growth in the South in A2 and B2</strong>
Due to the continued poverty and regionalisation in the A2 and B2 scenario, the population in Africa, South America and Asia will experience a slow demographic transition and consequently, will grow (much) faster than in the A1 and B1 scenario. The African population will grow with 80% in the period 2000-2030 in the A1 and B1 scenario and with 90% in the A2 and B2 scenario. The population in Asia will grow with 20% in A1 and B1, and with 30-40% in A2 and B2.
</p>
  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Pressure on land and biodiversity</strong><br>
In Africa and Asia the pressure on (new) land and biodiversity is high in all scenarios, mainly due to a strong increase in population. In Latin America, the change in pressure depends more heavily on the scenario. In scenarios with more free trade (A1 and B1) agriculture grows at the cost of natural vegetation. This agricultural expansion will lead to production systems on low productive lands leading to a higher vulnerability of the region to changes in the natural carrying capacity.

<p>
<strong>Winners and losers</strong><br>
Some developing countries and some groups within these countries benefit form trade liberalization, especially exporting countries (Brazil, Argentina etc.). Countries that now benefit from special import arrangement (e.g. for sugar) with the EU will loose ground. Since in general commodity prizes will rise after trade liberalization, food importing countries will face welfare losses.

</p>

  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>Effects for Europe</strong><br>
The changes in developing countries will inevitably have an impact on the European community. Large income
gaps combined with a high population pressure and the deterioration of ecosystem services in developing
regions,
can lead to immigration pressures on Europe. In fast-growing scenarios like A1 and B1, the sudden expansion
of land use in Africa and Latin America might lead to unsustainable agricultural practices resulting
in water shortage and/or land degradation. A decreasing agricultural productivity in these regions will
surely slow down the economic growth and therefore, the chances for full participation in the globalized
trade system. In A1, the uncontrolled growth in agricultural practices in Africa, Asia and Latin America
will enhance the intensive use or abuse of water and nutrients. The coinciding environmental problems
in these regions might outpace the European problems of the latest decades with unforeseen impacts on
other regions like Europe. The various risks in the scenarios mentioned might support the idea that Europe
should safeguard its own food production capacity for both self sufficiency and its role in global food
supply.
