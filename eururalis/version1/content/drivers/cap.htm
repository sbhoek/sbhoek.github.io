			Production growth of products under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the EU 15 countries is lower than for other agricultural products (Non-CAP). Reduction of border support has a higher negative effect than domestic support reduction.
  </p>

			This figure describes EU15 production growth for products under CAP (grains, oilseeds, sugar,
			  beef and dairy) and other agricultural products (Non-CAP, such as horticulture, pork and
			  poultry). For CAP and Non-CAP products we give the total production effect which is the
			  result of all scenario’s
			  assumptions (“CAP-total” and “Non-CAP-total” respectively). For CAP products the isolated contribution
			  of changes in border support (CAP-border support) and domestic support (CAP-domestic support)
			  is also depicted. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Production growth of  products with protection of CAP is lower than for other agricultural products in all scenarios. Reduction of border support has a significant negative impact in the global scenario’s (A1 and B1) where all border support is abolished. The impact is less severe in the B2 scenario where all export subsidies are abolished. However, the reduction of output for CAP commodities in B2 can largely be explained by the reduction of border support because there is no ofsetting impact of high income growth.
			</p><br>
			<p>
			The impact of reduction of border support and domestic support has a small positive impact
			  on the production of Non-CAP commodities.

			Production growth of CAP-protected products is lower than for other agricultural products (N-CAP). Accession to the European Union has a positive impact on the production of CAP commodities in the EU10, especially in B2 scenario.

			This figure describes EU10 production growth for products under CAP (grains, oilseeds, sugar,
			  beef and dairy) and other agricultural products (Non-CAP, such as horticulture, pork and
			  poultry). For CAP and Non-CAP products we give the total production effect which is the result of
			  all scenario’s
			  assumptions (“CAP-total” and “Non-CAP-total” respectively) and the isolated contribution of changes
			  in border support (CAP-border support) and domestic support (CAP-domestic support).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Production growth of  products with protection of CAP (grains, oilseeds, sugar, beef and dairy) is lower than for other agricultural products (horticulture, pork and poultry). If income rises people spend relatively more money on Non CAP products (higher income elasticity). 
			</p><br>
			<p>
			The impact of changes in border and domestic support is relatively limited in the liberalisation
			  scenarios compared to the impact in the EU15 (see figure). It is slightly positive for
			  CAP and slightly negative for Non-CAP commodities due to EU accession effects in first
			  periods. The main
			  driving force for production growth is economic growth.
		</p>
			<br>
		<p>
		For the regionalisation scenarios (especially B2) the impact of changes in border and domestic
		  support is more important. One the one hand, economic growth is lower and on the other hand, benefits
		  of accession to the EU15 are less eroded by liberalisation. CAP payments are not reduced or even
		  increase (B1) and access of other countries to the EU is not enhanced.
		</p>

		Production growth of  products with protection of CAP is lower than for other agricultural products. Accession to the European Union including its CAP facilities has a positive impact on the production of CAP commodites in the EU10.

	<strong>CAP: Common Agricultural Policy of European Union</strong><br>
	<strong>Products under CAP:</strong>  product with a relatively high degree of market regulation due to the Common Agricultural Policy. Products in this category are grains, oilseeds, sugar, beef and dairy.<BR>
	<strong>Non-CAP products:</strong> agricultural products with a low degree of market regulation under CAP. Products in this category are horticulture, pork and poultry.
	<br><br>
    <strong>Border support:</strong> changes in export subsidies and import tariffs. 
    <br>
	<strong>Domestic support:</strong> changes in subsidies to the farmer (e.g. area payments, slaughter premiums). <br>
