<p  >Driving forces are  externally working forces exerting influence on  the European rural area
  and its functions for society. They are relatively exogenous, such as the global economy
  or global change processes. Various forces  act synchronously and interact. Their  impact will vary
  through time and from region to region. Their future role is hard to assess: some of them are principally
  hard to predict, others can be quantified between reasonable limits. The
   scenario approach tries to specify consistent story lines that distinguish between the
  nature, rate and extent of various driving forces We distinguish:
<br><br>
<ul style="width:500px;">
<li><strong>natural forces</strong> affecting natural or cultural ecosystems, such as natural or man-induced climate change or sea level rise. Major disasters, such as earthquakes, flooding  or epidemic diseases could be added but are hard to include. Such incidents are hard to predict in nature, size, region or impact. Expectations on Global Change however have scientifically and politically converged.</li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>geopolitical change</strong>: it can be expected that the effects of the EU enlargement will
  continue while further expansion is possible, in some scenarios. International agreements (WTO or other)
  seem to gain momentum (e.g. scenario B1), in others their role is much more modest.</li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>Demographic change</strong>: growth, decline of populations, major migration flows, and in
  case of declining population growth the ageing of people. Specific for rural areas the flow from rural
  to urban areas is relevant. </li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>World economy</strong> is a powerful determinant of changes in agriculture and other sectors
  (industry, services). Supply and demand determine trade. For agriculture the changes in food demands are important.</li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> is a major driver. It causes huge and fast shifts, in agriculture
  via higher efficiency in production (per farm, per hectare, per hour), the pull from other economic
  sectors for capital, labour, space and how non-economic activities of people can be realized (mobility
  of persons, recreation patterns). Completely  new inventions are hard to predict,
  once their relevance has been shown dissemination of technologies can be assumed.</li>
<br><br>
<li><strong>Consumer patterns</strong> encompass al kinds of human preferences and behaviour .This varies
  from preferences in diet, attitude towards animal welfare, nature conservation to the acceptance of
  government intervention. </li>

</ul>
