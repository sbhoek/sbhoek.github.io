<p class="kop">Growth of crop production is relatively low in the EU25 countries in all scenarios. Despite liberalisation the EU25 countries obtain the highest growth in the A1 scenario.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Crop production growth is low in the EU relative to other countries/continents. Lower economic growth in combination with a low income elasticity are important in this respect. In the liberalisation scenario’s (A1, A2)  sugar production in the EU will decline substantially (see Figure P3). In the B1 and B2 scenario’s crop production is relatively low due to lower demographic and economic growth and less demand for  fodder crops due to less meat consumption. These effects are higher for the EU15 than for the EU10.</p>
<br>
<p>
For countries outside the Transatlantic market in the A2 scenario crop production is lower than in other scenario’s due to low economic growth and no enhanced access to Transatlantic market.

<br>
<p class="kop"> Milk production in the EU 25 stabilizes more or less in all scenarios. The production
  of eggs and pig and poulty meat increases in A1 and A2 by 25% in 2030, due to higher global demand.
  In the B1 and B2 scenarios this production stablizes compared to 2000, due to low economic growth and
  declining preference for animal protein.</p>

<br>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The number of dairy cows remains more or less stable in all scenarios. Only in the Regional Communities scenario the number of cows decreases with 6% compared to 2000.
</li>
<li>
The number of pigs and poultry increases in all scenarios, again except the Regional Communities scenario. The Global economy scenario shows even a strong increase in livestock production (of more then 30%).
</li>
<li>
The number of beef declines in all scenarios, except in the A2 scenario which shows a growth of 5%.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
</p><p>
Livestock production growth is low in the EU relative to other countries. Lower demographic and economic
  growth are important explanations. In the EU15 and other high income countries meat consumption declines
  due to preference shift in diet, especially in the B1 and B2 scenarios. For the EU10 (and developing
  countries) this effect is smaller: higher income leads to higher consumption. The pig and poultry sector
  are hardly influenced by the CAP. The pig and poultry sector therefore respond mainly to trends in
  global markets. Developments in meat demand are determined by world population, combined with changes
  in GDP per capita and consumer preferences. In general, meat consumption increases when people get
  richer. In Global Economy (A1), the world demand for meat and other animal products doubles up to the
  year 2030.</p>

<p class="kop">
Production growth in primary agriculture is lower than in processed food, industry and services. In this liberalization scenario (A1) sugar  production declines strongly.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Production growth in primary agriculture is lower than in processed food, industry and services. Within primary agriculture growth is relatively high in horticulture and pork and poultry. A high growth in pork and poultry induces a relatively high growth in (feed) grains. Beef production in the EU15 remains stable and increases in EU10. In this liberalization scenario sugar production declines strongly as production in other continents is taking over after abolishing trade barriers.
