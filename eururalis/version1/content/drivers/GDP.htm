		Gross Domestic Production (GDP) is assumed to grow in all scenarios for all continents. GDP growth per capita is a measure for income increase. </p><br>
		<p class="kop">

		  groups of countries (Asia shows highest rates)</p>

		  <p> <br> 
		  The process of transition continues in the accession countries (EU10). Income growth is high
		    (2-3 times that of the EU-15). The level of income is less than 50% of that of the EU-15
		    and there is ongoing structural change in their economies and especially in agriculture. Economic
		    growth
		    will accelerate in the EU-10 after accession. Structural change will be supported by structural
		    funds and rural development. The EU-15 economies are more saturated. Their economies grow
		    slowly and there are relatively stable structures in the whole economy.    	  </p>
	      <br>
		  <p>
		  The Global Economy (A1) scenario  assumes the WTO negotiations are successful, global
		  trade fully liberalized and a further Eastwards EU enlargement (including Turkey). Technological
		  change is high. Poor countries will catch up and experience high economic growth. This scenario
		  shows the highest income growth for almost all regions.
   	  </p>
				  <br>
				  <p>
				  Global Cooperation (B1) scenario assumes that international cooperation is successful and trade will be liberalized, but under conditions for people and planet (e.g. climate change). This results in lower productivity growth in economic terms and a lower economic development than in A1, especially for the EU where these concerns are important. We observe high growth rate in the EU accession countries (EU10). 
				  </p>
				  <br>
				  <p>
				  	In the Continental Market (A2) scenario the focus is on markets, though national
				  	  or continental interests prevails. The United States, Canada and the EU create
				  	  a Trans-Atlantic internal market. This yields welfare gains in these regions, in
				  	  contrast with poverty in developing countries.
				  </p>
				  <br>
				  <p>
				  In the Regional Communities (B2) scenario both economic and non-economic values are
				    important while regional or national interests prevail. Trade and agricultural policies remain
				    almost unchanged, except for export subsidies. EU integration is only partial and technological
				    change is limited. The resulting economic growth is lower than in other scenarios. Social values
				    lead to catching up of developing countries because they can adopt existing technologies from
				    developed countries.

		<p> 
			Share of agri-food complex in economy keeps on falling in all scenarios for 2030 compared to 2000. The higher the welfare level in a country the more important industry and services become and the lower the share of the agri-food complex.

  </p>

		 <a class="map" href="MapGroup.app$group=GDP">show maps</a>
		 <br> 
	  
	  
		  <p> <br> 
		  The historic trend continues in the sense that the shares of agri-food complex in economy keeps on falling. On the one hand people spend relatively less money on food as their income gets higher (low income income elasticity of demand) ,on the other productivity growth is higher than in other sectors such as services. The latter effect causes that agricultural prices decline relatively to the general price index. People do not buy much more food if it gets cheaper (a low price elasticity of demand). All in all the value share of agriculture will decline.
   	  </p>
	  <br>
		  <p>
		  Faster economic growth leads to a lower share of the agri-food complex. For the EU15 and the US this implies that the share is lowest in the A1 and A2 scenarios where growth is highest. For most developing countries outside the Continental market, the A2 scenario implies the highest share of agriculture in 2030. Economic development is slow in developing countries.
