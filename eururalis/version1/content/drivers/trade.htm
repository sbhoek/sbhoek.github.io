		Trade within and outside Europe depends strongly on scenario's. Global scenarios (A1, B2)  promote
  trade with the non EU countries, regional scenarios trade within the enlarged EU. </p>
<br><br>
	<p class="kop">The enlargement
		    of the internal EU market promotes trade between the EU15 and EU 10 countries.</p>
	<p class="kop"> EU 10 (accession)
		      countries benefit even more from a larger EU market than the EU 15 countries. </p>

	A fast growth of exports of agrifood of EU15 with EU10 due to accession occurs in all scenarios The
	  highest growth in trade with the rest of the world, especially Asia and Africa, takes place in
	  the Global scenarios (A1 and B1). Intra EU15 trade growth is limited.
	</p>
	<br>
	
		<p> 
			Economic growth and changes in border support are important drivers of trade. The impact of changes in domestic support are limited. The contribution of changes in border support are given in Figure T EU2. Export Growth with EU10 countries will be high due to accession. The accession contributes about 50% in the high income growth A1 scenario and is responsible for almost all trade growth in the low income growth B2 scenario (compare Figure T EU1 ad Figure TEU2). Trade growth with the rest of the world is high in the global scenarios (A1 and B1). Trade liberalisation is important for all regions (see Figure T EU2) and the most important contributor to export growth to High Income countries and Central and South America. High income growth is most important in trade with Africa and especially Asia. Intra EU15 trade is low due to low economic growth. Trade liberalisation contributes negatively to intra EU15 trade due to loss of preferential access to each other market if other countries get the same free 
			access.

			<p ><img src="../../images/content/drivers/trade_tradegrowth.gif" border="1" style="float:right; margin-left:10px;">
			For EU10 exports: Intra EU10 trade growth is highest as trade barriers have been cleared with their entrance to the EU; accession to the EU creates opportunities especially in regional scenarios (A2 and B2); Trade growth with rest of the world is higher in Global scenarios (A1 and B1).
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>The creation of a large  internal EU25 market creates opportunities for EU10. Not only trade with EU15 but especially intra-EU10 trade will blossom. Trade growth with other countries higher in liberalization scenarios. Trade with Asia is high due to income growth in this region</p>

	<p>	<img src="../../images/content/drivers/worldtrade1.gif" style="float:right; margin:10px;">The difference in world trade growth between liberalization scenario’s and non liberalization scenarios is striking. The higher growth in the liberalization scenarios is caused by the higher income growth in developing countries and the impact of liberalization itself (see figure T2). </p>
	<br>
	<p>The growth in world trade is highest in pork and poultry and oilseeds. The trend in trade that oilseeds trade is growing faster than wheat and coarse grains is expected to continue. The main exporters of oilseeds are Brazil and the USA and the main importers are located in Asia (especially China).</p>
	<br>
	<p class="kop">The reduction of border support in scenario A1 contributes significantly to the growth of world trade in grains, beef, processed food and especially sugar. The impact of reduction of domestic support is limited.</p>

<br>
<p> <img src="../../images/content/drivers/worldtrade2.gif" style="float:right; margin:10px;">The reduction of border support in the A1 scenario contributes significantly to the growth of world trade in grains, beef, processed food and especially sugar. The impact is limited for oilseeds, industries and services. For industries this is caused by trade liberalisation in earlier WTO rounds (e.g. Uruguay round). </p>
<br>
<p> The impact of reduction of domestic support is very limited and slightly negative. The impact is negative because the reduction of subsidies increases prices of current exporters.</p>
