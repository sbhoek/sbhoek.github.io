<p class="kop">Each scenario encompasses an ongoing temperature increase for the coming decades
</p>
<p class="kop">Scenarios for climate change do not differ strongly for the next three decades; thereafter
  scenarios diverge considerably due to differences in demography, economy and policy measures </p>
<br>
<p class="kop">Dryer (and hotter)  summers will occur in the South and warmer as well as probably wetter winters in the North </p>

Future climate change strongly depends on emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O. Scenario A1 shows the highest
  emissions and B1 is the only scenario where climate policy is successfully implemented. Here, it is
  assumed that the greenhouse gas concentration will stabilize at 550 ppmv CO2-equivalents. In B2 climate
  policy is implemented on a local scale through regional initiatives like implementation of wind and
  solar energy systems. Because of the low economic growth in the A2 scenario, this scenario shows low
  emissions until 2030 (see Figure). However, the expected growth of population in A2 will probably result
  in high temperatures by the end of the century.

Because of inertia in the climate system the consequences for the global-mean temperature change are
  very similar in the four scenarios for the coming three decades as taken by EURURALIS as time horizon.
  The B1 scenario even shows the highest temperature in the first decades. This result is related to
  the climate policies that are implemented in the energy system: less coal not only decreases the CO2
  emissions, but also the SO2 emissions. And since SO2 aerosols have an instant cooling effect compared
  to a long-lasting warming effect of CO2 concentrations, the decrease of SO2 particles increases the
  temperature immediately. The effect of CO2 reductions are visible after 2030 (not shown). Results for
  A1 show that this high-consumption scenario will lead to high temperature levels by 2030, having a
  major impact on the agricultural system through CO2 fertilization and changes in temperature level
  and precipitation.

The impacts of climate are very different regionally. The local effects are very uncertain. Studies of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that the models are very consistent in simulating warmer winters in Northern parts of Europe, when high emission scenarios are assumed. In contrast, the Mediterranean area will experience warmer summers in most of the models. These warmer summers will be combined with drier conditions. It is important to see that models often disagree on where precipitation is less or more, but that most of the models show a consistent drying sign in the Mediterranean area (see two Figures below for temperature and precipitation change). The combination of drier and warmer summers can have a major impact on the natural system and for humans (health, water supply, ecosystem services). In the North of Europe wetter winters are likely.

Impacts on extreme weather events are very uncertain and are not included in this study.
