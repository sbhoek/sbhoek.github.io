  <p class="kop"> Yield increases in agriculture during the existence of the EU were huge and a major
    driving force for food supply, import/export changes, decrease in employment and impacts on nature
    and landscape. </p>
  <br>
  <p> <br>
    Agricultural yields, per hectare, per hour labour or per animal (meat or milk) have increased drastically
      over time. Around 1400 AD (Middle Ages) cereal production was 800 kg/ha, around 1910 2000 and in
      2000 the amount was 9000 kg/ha. Labour hours per hectare decreased from 500-700 (around 1400 AD)
      to 300-400 (1910) and 8-15 (in 2000). Comparable developments can be observed in other branches:
      horticulture, dairy, meat. Factors are manifold and mutually reinforcing: fertilizers, control
      of production circumstances (e.g. drainage, irrigation, soil cultivation, mechanization, new cultivars,
      animal breeds, pest control). </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> FAOSTAT data for the EU 15 respectively EU 25 show this increase for five major crops (wheat, grain
    maize, rape seed, sugar beets, potatoes) from 1962 onwards. Yields often doubled or increased even
    more !</p>
  <br>
  <p>The significance for land use, food production and labour is evident: increase in farm scales, low
    food prices, a shift from an import to an export position for many countries, large scale expulsion
    of labour and impacts on nature and landscapes due to scale enlargement, intensification and specialization.</p>

    for all EU 25 countries, however, recent studies of EUROSTAT show that for some 40 regions of the
    United Kingdom and Finland saw agricultural employment stabilise or even rise between 1983 and 1997.
    The expectation is that the share of agriculture in regional employment in general will decrease

        <p> Recent outbreaks in the EU member states of Foot-and-Mouth Disease in cattle, Classical Swine

        <br>
        <p> The use of stamping-out strategies to stop the spread of the virus also caused societal outcry.

  <p> The history of European forests is very important to understand any historic, present and future
    carbon balance of the total system. Some 5000 years ago Europe was almost completely covered with
    forests. But with the north-ward spreading of civilization and agriculture over Europe, a process
    of deforestation started. This deforestation left many countries with less than 10% of forest cover
    in the late Medieval years. Much of the deforested areas were further degraded through heathland
    sod cutting, fuelwood collection, grazing, slash and burn agriculture, and wind erosion. Then, in
    the late 19th, early 20th century, due to intensification of agriculture, much of the degraded areas
    were not needed anymore and were afforested (photo 1 and 2). Therefore, European forests can be characterised
    as forests in a vegetation rebound phase, intensively tended for wood production. <br>

  <p>An analysis of historic data revealed that for the period 1950&#8211;1970, the average net sink

    120 million t C /y for the period 1981-1999. The small sink of the period 1950-1970 is mainly caused
    by the fact that almost all increment was harvested during that period. After 1970 the increment
    starts to increase, and since fellings went down in the 1990s, the largest sink in the total system
    was found for this last decade, with an average of 140 million t C /y</p>

    in particular in the most intensive areas of livestock breeding and fertiliser application At least
    30-40% of EU-15 rivers and lakes show eutrophication symptoms or bring high nitrogen fluxes to coastal
    waters and seas. The agricultural origin of these nitrogen fluxes accounts for 50 to 80% of total
    nitrogen inputs Some 55% of terrestrial ecosystems in EU-25 also receive nitrogen loads above the
    critical values . Pesticide policy is still highly influenced by national policies and differs among

    dynamics in trade (import or export of farm products), the need for forest and nature or recreation
    areas have affected land use, as can be read in land use statistics. We derived data from EUROSTAT
    for the EU15 countries in total for the major rural land use categories and give examples for forest
    and agricultural land per country. The general picture for the period of about forty years is a gradual
    increase in forest area, a decrease in agricultural land (about 160 million to 140 million), a decrease
    showing for both arable land and permanent pastures. Not shown in the graphs is the increase in area
    of built up area and nature (other than forest). Both other graphs give national data for forest
    and permanent pasture. These show in general a very parallel trend for most countries, though interesting
    differences appear. For example the decrease in permanent pasture is more outspoken in countries
    such as France and Germany, whereas Spain shows a decline followed by a recovery after the eighties.
