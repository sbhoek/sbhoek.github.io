  <p class="kop"> Manifest driving forces over the past 30 years comprise economical globalization, geopolitical
    change, such as the EU formation, new technologies, demographic growth and consumption patterns.
    They were decisive in land use change.</p>
  <br>
  <p> <img src="../../images/content/boom-met-4-kruinen.gif"  style="float:right; margin:20px;"> Driving
    forces are symbolised by the roots of the tree. Their relative importance varies depending on a certain
    world vision (scenario), as symbolised by the scenarios A1, B1, A2 and B2. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>what are drivers?</strong> </p>
  <p> Drivers are relatively externally working forces exerting influence on the European rural area.
    They act synchronously and interact with each other. Their impact varies through time and from region
    to region. We distinguish :
  <ul>
    <li>Natural forces</li>
    <li>Geopolitical change </li>
    <li>Demographic change </li>
    <li>World economy </li>
    <li>Technology </li>
    <li>Consumer patterns </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>In recent decades all categories have been at work in Europe. Some seem to have had minor impacts
    (climate change so far; Others had a quite contrasting course than expected for the future (demography)),
    others such as the EU-formation and expansion, a rapidly developing globalization or the strong influence
    of new technologies seem to have had an influence that has not yet ended. </p>

  <p class="kop"> The average temperature in Europe has increased by 0,95 oC in the last 100 years</p>
  <p class="kop"> From 1850 to1980 glaciers in the Alps lost about one third of their area and half of
    their mass</p>
  <p class="kop"> Climate change increased the length of the growing season by 10 days between 1962 and
    1995</p>
  <p class="kop"> Changes in temperature and precipitation differ over Europe. The last decade northern
    Europe got considerably more precipitation, southern Europe considerably less. The warming was highest
    in NW Russia and the Iberian Peninsula</p><br>
  <p class="kop">Extreme events seem to occur more frequently</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p><br>
    Due to increased emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFC's and
      HCFC's) since pre-industrial times atmospheric concentrations increased with 34 %. An acceleration
      in greenhouse gas emissions can be observed since 1950. </p>
  <p><br>
    Climate change, visible in raised temperatures and change in precipitation patterns has been documented.
      The global temperature has increased by 0.7 +/- 0.2 centigrade over the last century, the 1990's
      were the warmest decade in the observed records. Europe has warmed somewhat more than the global
      average, with a 0.95 centigrade increase since 1900. Winter temperatures increased more than summer
      temperatures. The warming was highest in NW Russia and the Iberian Peninsula, </p>
  <p><br>
    The effect of warming had strong impacts on glaciers in Europe. In eight out of nine European glacier
      regions a strong retreat has been observed: about one third of the area and one half of their mass
      vanished between 1850 and 1980. Since then 20-30 % of the remainder was lost. Rainfall patterns
      in Europe have not been documented as well as temperature. Recent observations for the last decade
      show contrasting patterns: northern Europa was 10-40 % wetter, southern Europe up to 20 % drier
      than the average for the century </p>

<div id="img_4" style="left:40px; top:730px; width:900px;  visibility:hidden;">
<p><strong>CAP</strong><br><br></p>
  <p class="kop"> The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) primarily focused on food security, low food prices
    and higher incomes for farmers. Later this scope was widened to rural development, social, environmental
    and ecological goals. Compliance to international trade agreements (WTO) is strived for. Complementary
    policy fields were developed for environment, nature conservation and restoration and water management. </p>
  <p style="float:right; margin-left:40px;  margin-bottom:50px; width:200px;"> <img src="../../images/content/past/mansholt.jpg" width="134" height="187" border="1"> <br>
    Mansholt was commissioner for Agriculture (from 1958 untill 1972) and was among others responsible
      for the creation of the CAP. While he was responsible for the successes of the CAP, he also was
      fully	aware of the drawbacks. His thinking was strongly influenced by the “Club of Rome” and he
      tried to reverse the negative aspects of the CAP. For a brief period in 1972 he also was president
      of the European Commission. </p>
  <br>
  <p> At the start of the EU the primary challenges for the agricultural sector were to prevent hunger,
    to provide cheap food and to raise incomes of farmers. Measures were market protection (tariff walls),
    export subsidies, price support, research, education, subsidies for fertilizers etcetera. Successes
    were amazingly fast, changes were massive and even brought unexpected impacts: surpluses of wheat,
    milk, meat, environmental and ecological problems as well as concerns on regional economies and socio-cultural
    assets due to massive labour expulsion. Farmers in less favoured areas were supported separately.
    Concurrently worries emerged on the size of the EU budget spent to agriculture / rural areas (yearly
    budget nowdays is 40 Billion Euro's) and the disrupting effects on international trade as was felt
    by developing countries. A major challenge is to adjust the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) to agreements
    for international trade in WTO context (World Trade Organisation). EU's latest enlargement by 10
    new member states with a relative high number of farmers brought new challenges for the CAP. </p>
  <br>
  <p> EU's policy on agriculture and rural areas reflects the above developments. Since the days of Mansholt
    various minor and major adjustments have been made or set in motion. Quota were the answer on overproduction,
    environmental and ecological problems were addressed and in successive adjustments a shift was realised
    from production support to farmers income support. Broadening of targets included the shift in attention
    towards rural development (the so-called 2nd Pillar of the CAP; for which a growth in budget from
    5 to 10 % of the CAP budget was realised), where broader economic, social, environmental and ecological
    goals are combined. Successive CAP reforms aimed at these goals (McSharry, Agenda 200, Cap-reform
    2003). Overall policy shifted from production support measures to income support and sustainable
    agriculture. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Concurrently attempts to cut the budget and ways to comply with international agreements were made.
    Adjacent policy domains affect the use of rural areas as well. From the late seventies nature policy
    has developed: various conventions on wildlife protection, Bird and Habitat Directive, Natura 2000.
    Environmental regulations relate to land use (e.g. for nutrients, pesticides). Recently the Water
    Directive was introduced. All in all we see a broadening in goals, a stronger interaction of policy
    goals and an adjustment to international agreements. <br><br>
