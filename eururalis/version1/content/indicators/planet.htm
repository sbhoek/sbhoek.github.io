    C-emissions ; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Land use changes result in an additional net sequestration of 24 Million tonnes 
    carbon per year. The highest scores are for B1 and B2 scenarios, lower scores 
    for A1 and A2 The contribution in reaching Kyoto targets (reduction of 108 
    M tonnes for Europe) is limited to some 10% <br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    The most important contribution in forests can be expected in Central and 
    Eastern European countries, where growth conditions are good and fellings 
    are modest. </p>
  <br>
  <p> <br>
    For the net change in forest area: both the B1 and the B2 scenarios result 
    in a net increase of forest area of respectively 14 million and almost 
    11 million ha in total by 2030 (Figure 1). The A1 scenario initially leads 
    to a small loss of forest, and then a sharp increase in the period 2010-2020. 
    In total the A1 shows a net forest area increase of 6.7 million ha. The A2 
    leads to deforestation until 2020 of in total more than 5 million ha. In the 
    last period, some recovery of forest area occurs, but this is less than 0.8 
    million ha. Compared to the existing forest area of 164 million ha initially, 
    these changes are small. </p>

  <p > Net carbon balance of the full land use sector for the EU25 under the four 
    alternative scenarios </p>
  <p> A1 and A2 scenarios differ strongly partly because of very different forestation 
    trends. Around 2010, the difference is the largest with some 20 million tonnes 
    C/y. This shows that policies do have a large impact on land use and its related 
    greenhouse gas balance In view of Kyoto commitment of a total required reduction 
    of around 108 million tonnes C scenarios differ significantly. Taking into 
    account what formally can be considered as an extra contribution to the Kyoto 
    goals forest expansion could contribute some 24 tonnes or (because of the 
    CAP on eligibility under Kyoto) some 10 % of the commitment. Generally the 
    largest part of this contribution can be found in Central and Eastern European 
    countries where growing conditions are favourable and fellings are modest. 
    It has to be stressed that other land use and changes in land management could 
    reduce greenhouse gas emissions considerably, in cropland (fertilizers) and 
    especially in animal husbandry. </p>

    perspectives are in scenario's B1, followed by B2, A1 and A2.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="kop"> The overall sum effect for biodiversity in Europe in natural 
    areas in all scenarios is negative, more notably in Central and eastern Europe. 
    Some countries will experience a minor increase in biodiversity.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> <br>
    Biodiversity can be expressed as percentage of biodiversity in a pristine 
    reference situation, untouched by humans in sufficiently large areas. We distinguished 
    biodiversity in nature sensu stricto (forest, natural grasslands, wetlands 
    and comparable natural areas and in agricultural areas). In nature sensu stricto 
    major impacts are related to climate change, fragmentation by roads, Nitrogen 
    deposition and disturbance. In agricultural land the intensity of land use 
    is the main driver of change. Here we distinguished arable and pasture land. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Biodiversity in natural areas (forests, natural grasslands, wetlands, and 
    static land use types, link to CLUE legend) depends on area size and fragmentation 
    by infrastructure, stress due to pollution (via atmosphere or ground- and 
    surface water) and disturbance (e.g. traffic, recreation) and effects of climate 
    change. Land use change, as modelled in EURURALIS and made spatially explicit 
    in the CLUE results, gives various changes depending on the scenarios chosen.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Decline of alpine ecosystems. Rare alpine species are predicted to be replaced 
    by wide-spread species. Local biodiversity may seem to increase, but this 
    is caused by an increase in common species overcompensating the loss of rare 
    species. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Land abandonment and urbanization lead to changes in area of nature. Overall 
    effect is more area for nature in 2030 in scenarios B1&gt; B2 &gt; A1 compared 
    to the situation in 2000. There is less nature in A2.</p>
  <br>
  <p> More nature but lower average biodiversity. Increase in population pressure, 
    urbanization, and traffic intensity, especially in A1 scenario, lead to local 
    decrease in biodiversity in densely populated areas. Despite of more area 
    for nature in scenarios B1, B2 and A1, average biodiversity is predicted to 
    drop in most countries in all scenarios in 2030 compared to the situation 
    in 2000. Average biodiversity in natural areas is predicted to increase only 
    in Germany, only B1 scenario, Estonia, only B2 scenario, Latvia, A2, B1 and 
    B2 scenarios, Malta, only A1 scenario. The largest declines are expected in 
    especially central and eastern European countries, most in A1 scenario. The 
    ranking of scenarios differs per country. See figure. </p>

  <p> Most nature areas have a biodiversity value between 30 and 60%. The current

    more in the 61-100% class. Especially the A1 scenario, but also the other 
    scenarios for 2030 show an overrepresentation of low biodiversity values (&lt;50%). 
    Average biodiversity values for natural areas are 48.4 (2000), 45.8 (A1), 
    46.0 (A2), 46.5 (B1), and 46.2 (B2). See figure.</p>

  Biodiversity can be expressed as percentage of biodiversity in a pristine

    biodiversity in nature sensu stricto (forest, natural grasslands, wetlands

    major impacts are related to climate change, fragmentation by roads, Nitrogen 
    deposition and disturbance. In agricultural land the intensity of land use 
    is the main driver of change. Here we distinguished arable and pasture land. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p> In arable farming (including permanent crops) current ecosystem quality 
    is on average 10% of the original pristine Biodiversity, with a min-max range 
    of 6-22%. The remaining Biodiversity in grazing systems is much higher: 26% 
    on average with a range from 15% to 82%. The lower value is for intensively 
    fertilised and/or re-seeded permanent grassland. Extensive grazing in (semi) 
    natural areas has the highest ecosystem quality. The average ecosystem quality 
    of cropland in 2000 is among the highest in the EU10 countries: e.g. 22,3% 
    and 24% for cropland in respectively Slovenia and Poland. The production intensity 
    is unevenly distributed in Europe. In Eastern EU, the Mediterranean and in 
    mountain areas one can find extensive systems. The most intensive systems 
    can be found either in rich soils in low-lands (for example in the Netherlands) 
    or in irrigated systems e.g. Greece (see maps 2000). </p>
  <br>
  <p > <strong>Scenario results</strong> </p>
  <p> In arable farming the impact on Biodiversity is the highest in the scenario 
    A1, with in the middle A2 and B1, and lowest in B2. A1 results for many countries 
    in half of remaining ecosystem quality in cropland compared to the B2 scenario 
    in 2030. Differences between countries are considerable, depending on production 
    intensity in 2000 (see tables). In all scenarios ecosystem quality in arable 
    land decreased between 2000 and 2030, because of intensification of production, 
    except for 9 countries in the B2 scenario. </p>
  <br>
  <p> For grazing systems, differences between scenarios are relatively smaller, 
    but in absolute terms more Biodiversity is left compared to arable land. 
    Biodiversity gain by 2030 is expected in most countries in the B2 scenario, 
    except the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia in Eastern Europe. The A1 
    scenario resulted in Biodiversity loss in all countries. </p>

  <p class="kop"> Salinisation risk in Europe increases due to climate change; 
    Risk areas are found in southern and middle European countries Europe, along 
    low lying coastal areas and in soils with initial high salt contents. Regionally 
    higher sea levels could increase risks, though hardly within the coming decades 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p> <br>
    
    Effects of the scenarios on the change in risk classes is based upon the dynamic 
    parameters ‘climate’ and partly ‘irrigated land’, since soil type, elevation 
    do not change and sea level hardly changes until 2030. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Actual salinisation risk in 2000 is highest in the Mediterranean area, small 
    in Eastern Europe and absent in Northern and Western Europe. Along the coasts, 
    there are some areas potentially in risk due to seawater intrusion (e.g. western 
    part of the Netherlands). A small area in Hungary, France and Spain is potentially 
    in risk due to saline soil types. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The difference in salinisation risk between north and south Europe is increasing 
    for the 2010, 2020 and 2030 scenarios. This is totally due to the foreseen 
    climate change. The northern part is getting wetter where risk increase is 
    minimal, whereas the southern part is getting drier and hotter. Land and 
    water management practice will be decisive. Differences between scenarios 
    are minor, as climate change as such does not differ within the period until 
    2030. In later stages, after 2030 - 2100 however scenario will diverge significantly.

	<br>
	  <p class="kop"> Where rainfall intensities increase due to climate change erosion

  <p><br>
  
    Erosion sensitivity depends on soil type, slope and land use. Risks depend 
    on rainfall surplus and frequencies of high rainfall intensities. The changes 
    are mainly determined by land use change. Decrease or increase in arable land 
    is very important as arable land is very sensitive to erosion. Forests at 
    the opposite usually provide good protection against erosion. Changes in rainfall 
    intensity change have not been included, as these are not yet specified in 
    scenarios. </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> All scenario simulations (figure) predict a (much) smaller area with erosion 
    sensitivity for the future (until 2030) compared to the situation in 2000. 
    The main reason is a decrease in area of arable land. The B1 and B2 scenarios, 
    which imply a targeted land use planning, have the largest decrease in sensitive 
    areas (> 50 %). The graph includes subvariants (B1 var ; B2 var) in which 
    this "tailor made" land use planning is not included. These indicate evidently 
    smaller reductions in erosion sensitivity. The maps show results for southern 
    Italy, for 2000 and for scenario B1 in 2030, indicating a large decrease in 
    the area that is highly sensitive to soil erosion. </p>

  <p> Acidification and eutrophication have been recognized as major environmental 
    problems since the early 1970s. The main responsible compounds are sulphur 
    dioxide (SO2, acidification only), Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) 
    and their reaction products (e.g. sulphate, ammonium, nitrate). </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>

    
  <p> A critical load is the maximum deposition of acidifying or eutrophying compounds 
    that can be tolerated by the ecosystem without damaging effects. The critical 
    load is dependent on the soil type, the ecosystem involved and the climate. 
 Below the effects due to the deposition of Nitrogen 
    deposition (as nutrient) are presented.</p>
<br>
	<img src="../../images/content/indicators/planet/Eutrophication_cl_4scen_ANIMATION.gif">
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
 
 
  <p> Based on a European critical load dataset, covering 5.7 million square kilometer 
    of ecosystems, from the UNECE Coordination Center for Effects (e.g. Posch 
    et al; 2001) and Nitrogen depositions derived from the EMEP model the average 
    exceedance of the nutrient N critical load (eq/ha/yr) for ecosystems in a 
    50x50 km grid has been calculated. On average, the critical load for Nitrogen 
    is estimated at 800 mol N/ha/yr). </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p> In 2000, see table and figures below, 27% (66%) of the ecosystems in Europe 
    (EU25) were not protected against eutrophication with an average exceedance 
    of 67 (230) eq/ha/yr. In 2030 the percentage unprotected area increases (decrease) 
    in the A scenarios for Europe to 28-32% (EU25: 62-65%), with an average exceedance 
    in 2030 of 70-80 eq/ha/yr (220-250 eq/ha/yr). </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p> In central Europe (EU10) the area unprotected ecosystems increases in the 
    A-scenarios from 72% to 81-91% with an average exceedance of 400-460 eq/ha/yr. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
 
  <p> In the B-scenarios the percentage unprotected area decreases for Europe (EU25) 
    from 27% (66%) to 15-18% (36-41%) with an average exceedance in 2030 of 25-30 
    eq/ha/yr (80-100 eq/ha/yr). </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
 
  <p> For central Europe the unprotected area decreases in the B-scenarios from 
    72% to 58-62% with an average exceedance of 170-200 eq/ha/yr. Compared to 
    2000 the NOx emissions in 2030 will decrease in the EU-15 (-17 to -22% and 
    -52 to -65% for the A and B scenarios respectively) and show a mixed pattern 
    for central Europe (+13-14% and -10 to -11% respectively). </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
 
  <p> The ammonia emissions show less changes, for the A-scenarios (B-scenarios) 
    +5-8% (-10-11%) for the EU-15 and +13-14% (0-7%) for central Europe.
