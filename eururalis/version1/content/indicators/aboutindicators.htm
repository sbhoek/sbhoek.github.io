<p> EURURALIS' models simulated what the effects are of changes in boundary conditions 
  for the various domains of sustainability : People, Planet, Profit. The selection 
  of indicators depended on: 
<ul>
	
  <li> Issues of political interest. Recent EU documents were taken as entrance. 
  </li>
	<li>
	Data and causal relationships to assess changes for their effect should be available for the EU25 countries . 	
	</li>
	
  <li> The need to avoid overdoses of information. Indicators have been chosen 
    for their meaningfulness and their representativeness for other related aspects. 
  </li>
</ul>	

</p>
<br>
<p> Some indicators, e.g. biodiversity were build upon partial indicators representing 
  specific aspecsts (e.g. fragmentation effects, disturbance, pollution) or distinctive 
  areas and specimens (agriculturally used ecosystems versus natural areas). Some 
  were difficult to attribute exclusively to the 3P domain: animal diseases have 
  a link to the Planet domain (living creatures), the Profit domain (losses in 
  capital and income) and the People domain (acceptability of policy measures 
  like culling). The resulting list is far from complete and some vital aspects 
  could not be included. For example, data on various values of landscapes in 
  Europe, for instance on cultural heritage, could not be included for reasons 
  of data and methods lacking. Other data were only partly available (EU 15 countries 
  instead of EU 25 in case of animal diseases.) In the Profit domain several additional 
  data (off-farm income, contribution of recreation and tourism) would have been 
  relevant, but sofar not available. Socio-cultural aspects would contribute to 
  a more balanced input from the People domain, but where not at hand. </p>
<br>
<p> Built upon indicators we composed so-called Meta-indicators that give a more 
  comprehensive or geeralised picture, see '7 Integration', tab 'meta-indicators'.
