  <p class="kop"> Self-sufficiency of some CAP commodities (sugar and cattle) 
    in the EU 15 countries declines especially in the global scenarios (A1, B1). 
    Grains is exceptional because its self-sufficiency increases in all scenarios. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <img src="../../images/content/indicators/people/selfsuf15.gif" border="1"> 
  <p> <br>
    The general tendency is that the self-sufficiency of some CAP commodities 
    (sugar, beef and to a lesser extent dairy) declines for the EU15 and the selfsufficiency 
    of Non-CAP products (horticulture, pork and poultry) increases. This is most 
    profound in the liberalisation scenarios. Grains is exceptional within the 
    CAP commodites because its self-sufficiency increases in all scenario’s. </p>
  <br>
  <img src="../../images/content/indicators/people/selfsuf10.gif" border="1"> 
  <p class="kop"> Self-sufficiency of CAP commodities in the EU 10 countries increases 
    especially in regional (A2, B2) scenarios.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Self-sufficiency of CAP commodities increases especially in non-liberalisation 
    scenarios. Accession to the larger market of the European Union (trade creation) 
    and the existing CAP facilities increases production and self-sufficiency 
    in the EU10. This is most pronounced in the Regional communities (B2 )scenario 
    where the EU25 market does not integrate further with the rest of the world. 
    In the Continental market (A2) the impact of the preferential access of the 
    EU10 to the EU15 declines because the US and Canada get the same preferential 
    access. Another aspect is the lower economic growth in the EU10 in this scenario 
    that implies also a smaller increase in demand. </p>
  <br>
  <p> The Global economy or A1 scenario leads to a lower self-sufficiency of CAP, 
    Non-CAP and processed food in 2030 relative to 2001. The high income growth 
    stimulates demand for food. </p>
  <br>
  <p> In general the self-sufficiency of food in the EU10 is inversely related 
    to the general economic growth. The main explanation is that the differences 
    in income growth between the scenarios lead to substantial changes in the 
    demand for food while supply is more inelastic due to smaller differences 
    in productivity between scenarios. </p>

    Outbreaks of Classical Swine fever (CSF), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) and Avian Influenza (AI) can cause major direct and indirect economic losses, as well as societal problems and psychological  damage to farmers.
	 </p>
  <br>
  <p class="kop">
  Risks of spread of the diseases are currently high in some European regions due to the high concentration of farms in reduced areas, which results in farm densities above threshold values.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p class="kop">
  Free market scenarios (A1, A2) tend to raise risks due to higher production levels, more intensive trade and less regulation measures
  </p>
    <br>
	<p class="kop">
	Preventive vaccination can be considered for all scenarios.
	</p><br>
	<p>
	As explained in Past>indicators > Animal Diseases, the main consequences of an outbreak of contagious
	animal diseases are massive economic losses, which include direct (e.g. number of animals culled)
	and indirect damage ( e.g. loss of income in the tourist sector when rural areas are declared no-go
	areas
	for long periods). In addition, these epidemics may also cause severe animal welfare problems as
	well as significant psychological damage to farmers and other individuals directly involved. The
	outbreak and subsequent spread of the diseases are complex mechanisms, which depend on various factors.
	Key
	factors
	for uncontrolled spread, once the first infected farm of an epidemic of FMD, CSF or AI has been detected,
	and subsequently intervention measures have been introduced to stop further spread between farms,
	are the number of farms with animals susceptible for the disease and the spatial distribution of
	these farms.
	Therefore, the risk areas for CSF, FMD and AI can be assessed for the present situation by linking
	data on farm densities with critical distances between the farms. Based on previous literature analyses,
	we assumed densities of 1,5 farms per km2 for FMD, 5,5 farms per km2 for CSF and 2,5 farms per km2
	for	AI. The higher the farm density is, the faster the spread of the disease. Consequently, risk
	maps	were
	produced for each disease, indicating the risks in three classes (low, medium and high risk) for
	NUTS 1 and NUTS 2 areas. We restricted our analyses to the EU 15 countries, because there were no
	data	available
	for the 10 new Member States.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	The maps show the present risk areas, which include Austria, the majority of the Mediterranean countries and parts of the Netherlands for both CSF and AI. For FMD most of the EU countries have medium to high risks, except for some regions in Spain, France and Germany.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	It was not feasible to assess future situations based on the four scenarios, using the same methodology. Data availability at appropriate spatial scales was insufficient.
A second best option to assess the future, was to rank scenario's in a more qualitative way to identify the conditions that might influence the current situation positively or negatively.

	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	In general terms, the B scenarios are considered to incorporate, firstly a modest demand for animal products, and secondly a critical public opinion towards high concentrations of animals (e.g. for environmental reasons) and towards massive transport of animals by international trade. In these scenarios, governmental intervention could include spatial planning and other regulations aimed at prevention of animal disease spread.
	</p>
	
	<br><p>
	The A scenarios show the contrary pattern: higher productivity to satisfy higher consumption levels, more intensive transport, less regulation and less consumer concerns.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	All scenarios could theoretically encompass vaccination as intervention measure to achieve epidemic control, i.e. to stop further spread between farms, though international agreements are required.
