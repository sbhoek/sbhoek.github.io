    Crop production growth is low in the EU relative to other countries/continents. 
    Lower economic growth in combination with a low income elasticity are important 
    in this respect. In the Global scenario’s (A1, B1) sugar production in the 
    EU will decline substantially (see Figure P3). In the B1 and B2 scenario’s 
    crop production is relatively low due to lower demographic and economic growth 
    and less demand for fodder crops due to less meat consumption. These effects 
    are higher for the EU15 than for the EU10. </p>
  <p> <br>
    For countries outside the Transatlantic market in the A2 scenario crop production 
    is lower than in other scenario’s due to low economic growth and no enhanced 
    access to Transatlantic market. </p>

  <p> Livestock production in the EU 15 stabilizes or declines in B1 and B2 scenarios 
    due to low economic growth and declining preference for animal protein. </p>
  <br>
  <p> Livestock production growth is low in the EU relative to other countries. 
    Lower demographic and economic growth are important explanations. In the EU15 
    and other high income countries meat consumption declines due to preference 
    shift in diet, especially in the B1 and B2 scenarios. For the EU10 (and developing 
    countries) this effect is smaller: higher income leads to higher consumption.

  <p> Production growth in primary agriculture is lower than in processed food,

    in horticulture and pork and poultry. A high growth in pork and poultry induces 
    a relatively high growth in (feed) grains. Beef production in the EU15 remains 
    stable and increases in EU10. In this liberalization scenario sugar production 
    declines strongly as production in other continents is taking over after abolishing

  <p> In the past impressive increase in productivity in crops was observed. Likewise 
    the present situation can be assessed in terms of higher potential yields 
    when accounting for improvements in management and technology. The difference 
    between actual and feasible yields can be indicated as yield gaps. The higher 
    the yield gaps, the larger the opportunities to raise production levels./ 
    EURURALIS compared data for the period 1996 -2000 for the main crops (shown 
    in tables 1) taking into account water limitation as determined by weather 
    conditions in various EU countries. Calculations were carried out for the 
    current climatic conditions. The impact of climate change is dealt with elsewhere. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p> <strong>Actual yield gap (based on yield statistics and simulated potential 
    yields) </strong> <br>One important indicator is the gap between simulated potential 
    yield ( POTYield)the maximum that can be obtained for a specific crop cultivar 
    under given weather - i.e. if water, nutrients are optimum) and the actual 
    yields (STAT Yield) obtained. As indicator for this gap we have chosen (1-STAT/POTYield) 
    (see, table 1). </p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p> <strong>Theoretical yield gap due to water limitation </strong> <br>Furthermore, 
    as in many regions the water limitation can not be eliminated, it is relevant 
    to present theoretical yield gaps (1-WLYield/POTYield) (see, Table 2) based 
    simulations that quantify crop yield reduction due to water stress - assuming 
    that apart from temperature, irradiation no other factors than water availability 
    are limiting. </p>
  <p><br>
    In the following we further classified the yield gaps (expressed as fractions) 
    : 0. - 0.09 negligible (0); 0.1 - 0.19 low (1) , 0.2 - 0.39 moderate (2) ; 
    0.4 - 0.59 large (3) and >= 0.6 (4) very large. </p>

    yields.</p>

  <P > <strong>Effects of changing climate on Yields in Europe</strong></P>
  <P >&nbsp;</P>
  <p class="kop">Climate change relates to temperature, precipitation patterns and 
    weather dynamics (frequency of extreme events) and higher CO2 concentrations 
    as important growth conditions.</P>
  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</P>

  <p class="kop">In northern and northwestern parts climate change will probably 
    widen possibilities and bring yield benefits, in southern and central-eastern 
    Europe more droughts will affect agriculture. </P>
  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</P>

  <p class="kop">Adaptive strategies including new cultivars, adequate land use, 
    and good management practices will largely compensate drawbacks.. Overall 
    for Europe, yields will not become lower.</P>
  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</P>

  <p class="kop">Higher risks of yield loss will be encountered, if the frequency 
    and severity of extreme events (droughts, high intensity rainfall, flooding, 
    fire) increase further. It is still uncertain to what degree this will happen.</P>
  <p class="kop">&nbsp;</P>

  <p> Climate change projections for 2030 resp 2050 assume higher CO2 concentrations 
    .Pre-industrial concentrations were 280 ppm, currently 375 ppm, and are projected 
    to reach between 449-485 (B2 resp .A1) in year 2050. Average temperature and 
    precipitation are presented in maps illustrating future regional climatic 
    patterns. Generally temperatures are higher, more notably in northern 
    and northwestern regions where rainfall increases as well. Lower precipitation 
    and higher evaporation will especially affect Mediterranean countries and 
    central-eastern Europe. Climate dynamics seem to change, resulting in more 
    extreme events(droughts, high intensity rainfall, flooding). All these factors 
    potentially affect agriculture (choice of crops, potential yields, risks). 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Effects on production</strong><br>
    Generally the expectation is that yields will increase due to technology improvements, 
    as has been demonstrated in past, most notably, since World War II (see past); 
    in more favorable areas where growing conditions improve (higher CO2, length 
    of growing season, water availability) a combined positive effect is to be 
    expected. A northward shift of potential production areas enlarges possibilities 
    considerably. In other areas drought stress will occur. It is, however, expected 
    that adaptive strategies could compensate potential losses or hazards: careful 
    planning of land use in favorable areas (irrigated areas with good soils and 
    adapted management, introduction of appropriate crops and specific varieties 
    (e.g. maize). In those areas very high yields could be expected. The outcome 
    shows the overall positive development assuming that effective adaptive strategies 
    were applied in case of less favorable conditions. <br>
    Climate change is undoubtedly accompanied by a change in weather dynamics: 
    the occurrence of long-term, severe droughts, higher intensities of rainfall 
    and related processes (erosion) causing higher risks for agricultural use. 
    However, these changes can not yet be predicted with sufficient accuracy for 
    making meaningful impact assessments and spatial differentiations. The ultimate 
    impact of climatic changes on agricultural land use and yields will strongly 
    depend on adaptive measures including effective land use planning, land management 
    strategies and supportive policies. Therefore, it is difficult to predict 
    the overall effects. <br>
    Most expert judgments agree that for Europe's agriculture in a changed future 
    climate overall production will not be affected negatively. Adverse regional 
    effects will be found in southern and central eastern countries. Effective 
    land use planning and adequate management combined with technological advances 
    are expected to enable the agricultural sector to cope with most of the climate-induced 
    problems. Uncertainties relate to extreme events. </P>

  <p class="kop"> Real income declines for CAP commodities in the EU15, especially 
    in scenarios A1 and B1. Real income of CAP products is highest in the A2 scenario. 
    Real income is more or less stable for other agricultural products. For the 
    EU10 real income of both CAP and other agricultural products agricultural 
    products increases in all scenarios, the most in A1, the least in B2. </p>

    Market oriented scenario’s (A1 and A2) lead to highest income growth for all 
    sectors. The exception is the real income of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 
    products in the A1 scenario where subsidies are abolished and markets are 
    liberalised. Especially, the abolition of domestic support (area payments\animal 
    premiums or decoupled payments) has profound negative impact. The real income 
    of CAP commodities is about 50% in 2030 in the Global scenarios. The A2 scenario 
    leads to the highest real income for CAP commodities because overall income 
    growth is relatively high, domestic support is sustained, and markets are 
    only partially liberalised (only accession and creation TransAtlantic market). 
    Real income is more or less stable for other agricultural products while it 
    increases in the whole economy. A large part of real income in other “less 
    protected” sectors can be explained by overall income growth and the share 
    of income consumers spend on a certain product. </p>

  <p> <br>
    Real agricultural income growth is positive in the EU10 countries, although 
    it is lower than real income growth in the total economy. Overall economic 
    growth has an important impact on real farm income: consumers have higher 
    incomes and consumption patterns. Real agricultural income growth is highest 
    in A1 due to high overall income growth. Accession to the common EU market 
    (reduction of border support) and domestic support have a positive impact 
    on real agricultural income. The contribution is highest in the regionalisation 
    scenarios (A2 and B2) where domestic support is sustained and not all countries 
    get equal access to the EU15 market (preferential access sustained). </p>
  <br>
  <p> In comparison with the EU25 real farm income growth is higher, especially 
    for CAP commodities. The difference between CAP and Non_CAP agricultural products 
    is therefore much lower in the EU10. Furthermore, the contribution of domestic 
    support and border support is positive in stead of negative. </p>

  <p>The current CAP expenditures are about 37 billion euro (without rural area

    there is full trade liberalisation and abolishement of all domestic support. 
    In the B1 scenario payments are reduced to almost 15 billion euro because 
    all export subsidies will be abolished and only 37.5% of domestic support

    euro) due to accession and export subsidies (refunds) are kept. In the B2 
    scenario CAP expenditures are lower than in the A2 scenario because export 
    refunds are abolished. Direct payments are higher in the B2 scenario than
