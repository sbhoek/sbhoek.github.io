  Rural population : shrinking and ageing more than proportionally
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  All scenarios yield a strong decrease in rural population: from 100 million people in 2000 to around 75 million in 2030. The ageing of Europe’s population as forecasted will be even stronger in rural areas compared to urban areas. Ageing and depopulation will affect the viability of rural communities.

Firm future for farming, also in a global economy
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
 Agriculture, though shrinking in GDP share, employment and area will remain the principal player in rural areas in all scenarios. Also in a free market scenario where support measures are abolished. The scenarios encompass quite different agricultural policies, from abolition of Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy (tariffs, export subsidies, farm support) to maintenance of the present policy. Most scenarios (except A2) show a decrease of agriculturally used land. Land abandonment could create possibilities for a more sustainable agriculture and nature restoration

Inescapable climate change asks for adaptive strategies 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
Climate change will affect all Europe, more notably the Mediterranean, Alpine and northern regions. Impacts will increase in future decades due to time lag of processes and expected increase of problems due to economic growth in the 3rd World, especially in A1 scenario. Next to source oriented policies adaptive strategies are inevitable, to safeguard biodiversity, to allocate sustainable agriculture and to avoid risks such as flooding. Carbon sequestration by conversion of cropland into forest or by large scale bio-fuel production have limited contributions to Kyoto targets.

Accession: mutual profits for existing and new countries
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
The EU enlargement (EU15 + EU10) will bring economic profits to both the EU15 and EU10 countries. The EU 10 countries will be affected most, in economy, in socio-cultural and in ecological sense. Rates of transformations seem to be highest here, especially in free market conditions, having strong impacts in the social and ecological domains.

Rural transitions require support for social, cultural, ecological values in marginal areas.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
Transitions in rural areas can be fast and massive in certain regions. Most marginal areas will see land abandonment and socio-cultural and economic decline. Areas where agriculture will undergo further intensification, will be affected negatively in environment, biodiversity and landscape qualities. Both transformations demand an adequate strategy to safeguard values by spatial planning and management.

Urbanisation has many effects on rural areas
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
The tendency in all scenarios is that further urbanisation takes place, having effects on biotope losses, fragmentation of natural areas, environmental stress and larger claims on rural areas for recreation and tourism. Careful planning with respect to existing values and possible future risks due to climate change is required to direct urbanisation processes.

Supranational spatial planning still a missing link?
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
Many driving forces are Europe wide, many European policy responses tend to be thematic (aimed at a certain issue) and at the same time generic (valid everywhere), whereas national policies disregard supranational interests. In view of many problems surpassing national boundaries international spatial strategies including urban and rural areas are required.

Responsibilities for developing countries
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
In two scenario’s (A2, B2) strong trade barriers remain between the EU (and the USA + Canada) and other countries (both industrialized and developing countries). In developing countries this will lead to continued poverty of many people, accompanied by high population growth and more land conversion for subsistence agriculture. This affects social and ecological aspects negatively. Dismantling of trade barriers in itself is not enough: development aid and good governance in development countries are crucial as well

Scenarios are just a support to envisage threats and opportunities, no blueprint.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
Scenarios as presented serve as a help to envisage alternative futures. The four contrasting scenarios are not intended to suggest an either-or type of choice. Policy makers can, as the present state of policy making may illustrate, make their own choices that are well-considered compromises of  policy elements from more than one scenario.
