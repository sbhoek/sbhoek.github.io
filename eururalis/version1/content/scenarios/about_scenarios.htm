		EURURALIS has elaborated four scenarios, based on two, more or less independent “dimensions”: <br>
		(a) the type or degree of international cooperation (regional vs global) and <br>
	(b) the degree of government intervention (extensive vs limited). </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The four scenarios have a time horizon of 30 years (incidentally more) and operate in time steps
	  of 10 years. They start on a global scale before zooming in to the European Union; hence taking
	  into consideration the effects on Europe of developments world wide and vice versa (e.g. regarding
	  population,
	  economic
	  growth and trade policies). </p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The evolution of many driving forces is highly uncertain. Yet, policy makers need to anticipate on new challenges and opportunities. They need information on relationships as well: where to intervene effectively without causing adverse side-effects? The best scientists can offer is images of conceivable rather than probable futures. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Such explorative scenarios help to understand the significance of contrasting but equally plausible
      developments that could happen to the institutions involved; how these developments are related
      to trends in
      driving forces and to alternative cultural and political trends, conceivably starting off from
      the facts and fashions of today. <br>
