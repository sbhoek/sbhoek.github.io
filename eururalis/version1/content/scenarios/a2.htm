  <p class="kop"> Continental markets (A2)</p>
  <p>The Continental Markets scenario assumes:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>  That social and cultural values can best be preserved in regional political alliances with like-minded countries, within which nation states should keep as much sovereignty as possible. </li>
    <li>  Protection measures remain in place. Within this constraint, the society prefers market-based
    solutions.. </li>
    <li> The EU will form a single market with the US and Canada. No further enlargement of the EU will take place. </li>
    <li> The policy regarding the international mobility of people from third countries is restrictive. Cohesion policy is not seen as a priority. </li>
    <li> The overall economic growth rate is lower then in A1 and B1, especially in the Central and Eastern European countries as well as in developing countries.</li>
    <li> The technology development is also lower then in the other two scenarios.</li>
    <li> Maintenance (and extension) of nature reserves are mainly not a priority.  </li>
      <li> No further enlargement of the EU. </li>
  </ul>
