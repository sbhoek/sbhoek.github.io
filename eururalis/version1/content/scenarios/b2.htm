  <p class="kop"> Regional communities (B2)</p>
  <p>The Regional communities scenario assumes:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
		 <li> That social and cultural values can best be preserved at the local or regional community level;</li>
		<li>Self-reliance, ecological stewardship and equity are the keys to sustainability;</li>
		<li>No further development of supranational institutions. National governments remain responsible for foreign and security policy, fiscal policy, Justice etc.</li>
		<li>The cohesion policy receives little attention and remains ineffective;</li>
		<li>CAP subsidies: increase of some 10%, linked to environmental and social targets. Export subsidies are eliminated;</li>
		<li>Import barriers remain in place, to protect local markets against cheap imports;</li>
		<li>Imported goods have to comply with the high EU standards regarding health, environment, and animal welfare;</li>
		<li>The overall economic growth rate is the lowest of the four scenario’s;</li>
		<li>Through EU regulation (e.g. the Framework Water Directive) strict environmental regulation is imposed in the whole EU;</li>
		<li>The use of renewable energy sources is strongly supported by means of subsidies and R&D investments;</li>
		<li>Maintenance (and extension) of nature reserves and cultural heritage are a clear priority;</li>
		<li>The EU remains an EU of 25 member states.</li>
  </ul>
