  <p class="kop"> Global economy (A1)</p>
  <p>The Global Economy scenario assumes:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li> multilateral cooperation on economic issues, including successful WTO negotiations leading to elimination of almost all trade barriers. </li>
    <li> CAP subsidies and cohesion policy are phased out by 2030.</li>
    <li> Societies are predominantly driven by market-based solutions, resulting in high economic growth rates, particularly for poorer countries.</li>
    <li> A strong technology development. </li>
    <li> The role of the government is limited to core responsibilities, like basic education, security, major infrastructure ensuring conditions for competitive markets, law enforcement. </li>
    <li> Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria as well as some Balkan countries, Ukraine and some smaller countries have joined the EU. There is a flexible policy regarding migration. </li>
    <li> Maintenance (and extension) of nature  is not seen as a priority for the government and is mainly
    depending on private initiatives. </li>
  </ul>
