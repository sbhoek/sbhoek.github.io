  <p class="kop"> Global cooperation (B1)</p>
  <p>The Global co-operation scenario assumes:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li> Multilateral cooperation on many issues, aiming at a fair distribution of wealth, social justice and environmental stewardship. </li>
    <li> Trade barriers are gradually removed. </li>
    <li> Developing regions (inside and outside the EU) are support to eliminate poverty. </li>
    <li> The level of CAP subsidies is reduced, with domestic support specifically targeted at environmental sustainability and to catalyse rural development (2nd pillar of CAP). </li>
    <li> The economic growth rate in the EU and other OECD countries is strong, but less then in Global Economy. The economic growth in other regions is slightly higher then in Global economy.  </li>
    <li> A strong technological development, partly focussed on environmentally friendly production methods </li>
    <li> Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria have joined the EU. There is a flexible policy regarding international mobility of people from outside the EU. No limitation for migration among member countries. </li>
	<li> Maintenance (and acquisition) of natural and cultural heritage are mainly publicly funded.</li>
  </ul>
