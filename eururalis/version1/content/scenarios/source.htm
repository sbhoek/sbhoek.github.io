	<p>	The EURURALIS storylines were not invented from scratch. They are inspired by and elaborate on former studies, particularly the well known IPCC-SRES scenarios. Other important sources used are RIVM&#8217;s forthcoming Sustainability Outlook, the storylines of the ATEAM project and the GEO-3 scenarios for Europe study; the Macro-economic projections from the Four futures of Europe study of the Netherlands Economic Assessment Bureau (CPB, 2003). By combining various sources as mentioned EURURALIS tried to draw on accepted and authorized scenario-approaches, while adapting and detailing ingredients when necessary. Of course, by combining various approaches, EURURALIS scenarios differ from their inspiring precursors to a certain extent.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>From here a detailed and concrete elaboration of scenarios aimed at the EURURALIS goals has been
	  developed. Assumptions have been made on a host of factors, varying from trade liberalisation,
	  policies regarding migration of people, attitude towards environment and nature, abolishment of EU
	  subsidies,
	  expansion of the EU a.s.o. </p>
