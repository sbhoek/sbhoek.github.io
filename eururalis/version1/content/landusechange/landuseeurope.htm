		For EU 10 countries decreases of agricultural land in scenarios B1 and B2 are relatively modest due to EU support measures, the decrease in A1 is largest (10  %) 
		For EU 15 countries the strongest decline is seen in the B scenarios 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p class="kop">
		Built-up areas increase the most  in scenario A1 ( 6.2 % of total land area in EU25, comparable
		  with the complete area of the Netherlands), the least in B2 (4.3%) compared with a present
		  land cover of 3.9%. A relatively large increase is observed in the EU 10 countries.

		Bio fuels could occupy abandoned land. Huge areas are needed to meet EU goals for alternative
		  energy use in the transport sector (4-13 % of agricultural area) Short term goals probably will not
		  be met, energy efficiency so far is low.

	Scenarios vary in relative importance of drivers, such as population growth and consumption patterns,
	  support measures in the CAP that sustain or stimulate land use (especially in the B scenario's),
	  developments in the world (or continental) market (especially related to the A1 and A2 scenarios).
	  Agricultural land use furthermore reacts on the land demand from: interacting influences have been
	  made explicit in scenarios and used in models. The model outcomes  can be reviewed as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>
		In most scenarios a decrease in land demand from agriculture seems to reflect an ongoing trend
		  of higher productivity per hectare as already seen in the past. Educated guesses point to the
		  fact that  these trends continue due to technological improvements and better management.
		  This development runs parallel
		  with demands for land for other goals.
		</li>
		<li>
		 In scenarios where EU support is important (B scenarios) and where the accession countries can
		   take advantage of this a relatively low decrease in agricultural land use is to be expected.
		   In the EU 15 countries this effect is much less. The B scenarios assume a more modest population
		   growth, less welfare
		   and
		   lower consumption levels, liberalization scenarios assume the abolishment of support and demand
		   for other products.
		</li>
		<li>
		The A2 scenario remarkably diverges in agricultural land demand due to higher living standards
		  related to higher incomes, whereas Europe tries to reach a higher degree of self-sufficiency.
		  Cropland is used partly for animal fodder and increases. Farming intensities are relatively
		  low.
		</li>
		<li>
		Bio fuels are not yet included in land demand in the above figures. EU's targets to replace fossil
		  fuels by bio fuels for 2010 for the transport sector assume a 5.75 % share. Translated to surfaces
		  where bio fuels should be cultivated a substantial area, varying from 4 - 13 % should be realized.
		  This figure, though not realistic on a short time horizon, could imply that the majority of
		  agricultural land that otherwise could be abandoned could be used for bio fuels in the long
		  term.
The	probability	in economic terms and the low energy-efficientcy are both factors that obstruct such
		  huge transformation.</li>
		<li>
		Urban areas grow in all scenarios due to increase of population, higher living standards, demands
		  from the industrial and services sector, personal mobility. For EU 25 the areas increase from
		  6.2 areal % in 2030 in A1 scenario to 4.3% in B2 scenario, compared with 3.9% at present.
		  A relative strong increase can be observed in Central
		  and Eastern Europe where urbanisation will be strongest (leading to a drain of rural
		  communities. Strongest increase in EU10 countries occurs in A1 scenario (7.7 %
	  of land areas).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </li>
	    <li>Graphs show intriguing knicks around 2010. This can be attributed to the effects of CAP support
	      measures until 2013 (see scenarios), incorporated in model results. EURUALIS has choosen 2010
	      as interval which explains why the change is then.</li>
